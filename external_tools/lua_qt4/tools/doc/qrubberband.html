Detailed Description

   The QRubberBand class provides a rectangle or line that can indicate a
   selection or a boundary.

   A rubber band is often used to show a new bounding area (as in a
   QSplitter or a QDockWidget that is undocking). Historically this has
   been implemented using a QPainter and XOR, but this approach doesn't
   always work properly since rendering can happen in the window below
   the rubber band, but before the rubber band has been "erased".

   You can create a QRubberBand whenever you need to render a rubber band
   around a given area (or to represent a single line), then call
   setGeometry(), move() or resize() to position and size it; hiding (or
   destroying) the widget will make the rubber band disappear. The rubber
   band can be a Rectangle or a Line, depending on the shape() it was
   given when constructed.

Member Function Documentation

  QRubberBand::QRubberBand ( Shape s, QWidget * p = 0 )

   Constructs a rubber band of shape s, with parent p.

   By default a rectangular QRubberBand (s is Rectangle) will be set to
   auto mask, so that the boundary of the rectangle is all that is
   visible. Some styles (for example native Mac OS X) will change this
   and call QWidget::setWindowOpacity() to make the window only partially
   opaque.

  QRubberBand::~QRubberBand ()

   Destructor.

  void QRubberBand::move ( int x, int y )

   Moves the rubberband to point (x, y).

   See also resize().

  void QRubberBand::move ( const QPoint & p )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Moves the rubberband to point p.

   See also resize().

  void QRubberBand::resize ( int width, int height )

   Resizes the rubberband so that its width is width, and its height is
   height.

   See also move().

  void QRubberBand::resize ( const QSize & size )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Resizes the rubberband so that its new size is size.

   See also move().

  void QRubberBand::setGeometry ( const QRect & rect )

   Changes the rubberband's geometry to the geometry of the rectangle
   rect.

   See also move() and resize().

  void QRubberBand::setGeometry ( int x, int y, int w, int h )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Changes the rubberband's geometry to have a top-left corner of (x, y),
   a width of w, and a height of h.

   See also move() and resize().

  Shape QRubberBand::shape () const

   Returns the shape of this rubber band. The shape can only be set upon
   construction.
