Detailed Description

   The QVector class is a template class that provides a dynamic array.

   QVector<T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It stores its
   items in adjacent memory locations and provides fast index-based
   access.

   QList<T>, QLinkedList<T>, and QVarLengthArray<T> provide similar
   functionality. Here's an overview:
     * For most purposes, QList is the right class to use. Operations
       like prepend() and insert() are usually faster than with QVector
       because of the way QList stores its items in memory, and its
       index-based API is more convenient than QLinkedList's
       iterator-based API. It also expands to less code in your
       executable.
     * If you need a real linked list, with guarantees of constant time
       insertions in the middle of the list and iterators to items rather
       than indexes, use QLinkedList.
     * If you want the items to occupy adjacent memory positions, use
       QVector.
     * If you want a low-level variable-size array, QVarLengthArray may
       be sufficient.

   Here's an example of a QVector that stores integers and a QVector that
   stores QString values:
    QVector<int> integerVector;
    QVector<QString> stringVector;

   QVector stores a vector (or array) of items. Typically, vectors are
   created with an initial size. For example, the following code
   constructs a QVector with 200 elements:
    QVector<QString> vector(200);

   The elements are automatically initialized with a default-constructed
   value. If you want to initialize the vector with a different value,
   pass that value as the second argument to the constructor:
    QVector<QString> vector(200, "Pass");

   You can also call fill() at any time to fill the vector with a value.

   QVector uses 0-based indexes, just like C++ arrays. To access the item
   at a particular index position, you can use operator[](). On non-const
   vectors, operator[]() returns a reference to the item that can be used
   on the left side of an assignment:
    if (vector[0] == "Liz")
        vector[0] = "Elizabeth";

   For read-only access, an alternative syntax is to use at():
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.size(); ++i) {
        if (vector.at(i) == "Alfonso")
            cout << "Found Alfonso at position " << i << endl;
    }

   at() can be faster than operator[](), because it never causes a deep
   copy to occur.

   Another way to access the data stored in a QVector is to call data().
   The function returns a pointer to the first item in the vector. You
   can use the pointer to directly access and modify the elements stored
   in the vector. The pointer is also useful if you need to pass a
   QVector to a function that accepts a plain C++ array.

   If you want to find all occurrences of a particular value in a vector,
   use indexOf() or lastIndexOf(). The former searches forward starting
   from a given index position, the latter searches backward. Both return
   the index of the matching item if they found one; otherwise, they
   return -1. For example:
    int i = vector.indexOf("Harumi");
    if (i != -1)
        cout << "First occurrence of Harumi is at position " << i << endl;

   If you simply want to check whether a vector contains a particular
   value, use contains(). If you want to find out how many times a
   particular value occurs in the vector, use count().

   QVector provides these basic functions to add, move, and remove items:
   insert(), replace(), remove(), prepend(), append(). With the exception
   of append(), these functions can be slow (linear time) for large
   vectors, because they require moving many items in the vector by one
   position in memory. If you want a container class that provides fast
   insertion/removal in the middle, use QList or QLinkedList instead.

   Unlike plain C++ arrays, QVectors can be resized at any time by
   calling resize(). If the new size is larger than the old size, QVector
   might need to reallocate the whole vector. QVector tries to reduce the
   number of reallocations by preallocating up to twice as much memory as
   the actual data needs.

   If you know in advance approximately how many items the QVector will
   contain, you can call reserve(), asking QVector to preallocate a
   certain amount of memory. You can also call capacity() to find out how
   much memory QVector actually allocated.

   QVector's value type must be an assignable data type. This covers most
   data types that are commonly used, but the compiler won't let you, for
   example, store a QWidget as a value; instead, store a QWidget *. A few
   functions have additional requirements; for example, indexOf() and
   lastIndexOf() expect the value type to support operator==(). These
   requirements are documented on a per-function basis.

   Like the other container classes, QVector provides Java-style
   iterators (QVectorIterator and QMutableVectorIterator) and STL-style
   iterators (QVector::const_iterator and QVector::iterator). In
   practice, these are rarely used, because you can use indexes into the
   QVector.

   In addition to QVector, Qt also provides QVarLengthArray, a very
   low-level class with little functionality that is optimized for speed.

   QVector does not support inserting, prepending, appending or replacing
   with references to its own values. Doing so will cause your
   application to abort with an error message.

   See also QVectorIterator, QMutableVectorIterator, QList, and
   QLinkedList.

Member Function Documentation

  QVector::QVector ()

   Constructs an empty vector.

   See also resize().

  QVector::QVector ( int size )

   Constructs a vector with an initial size of size elements.

   The elements are initialized with a default-constructed value.

   See also resize().

  QVector::QVector ( int size, const T & value )

   Constructs a vector with an initial size of size elements. Each
   element is initialized with value.

   See also resize() and fill().

  QVector::QVector ( const QVector & other )

   Constructs a copy of other.

   This operation takes constant time, because QVector is implicitly
   shared. This makes returning a QVector from a function very fast. If a
   shared instance is modified, it will be copied (copy-on-write), and
   that takes linear time.

   See also operator=().

  QVector::~QVector ()

   Destroys the vector.

  void QVector::append ( const T & value )

   Inserts value at the end of the vector.

   Example:
    QVector<QString> vector(0);
    vector.append("one");
    vector.append("two");
    vector.append("three");
    // vector: ["one", "two", three"]

   This is the same as calling resize(size() + 1) and assigning value to
   the new last element in the vector.

   This operation is relatively fast, because QVector typically allocates
   more memory than necessary, so it can grow without reallocating the
   entire vector each time.

   See also operator<<(), prepend(), and insert().

  const T & QVector::at ( int i ) const

   Returns the item at index position i in the vector.

   i must be a valid index position in the vector (i.e., 0 <= i <
   size()).

   See also value() and operator[]().

  reference QVector::back ()

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   last().

  const_reference QVector::back () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  iterator QVector::begin ()

   Returns an STL-style iterator pointing to the first item in the
   vector.

   See also constBegin() and end().

  const_iterator QVector::begin () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  int QVector::capacity () const

   Returns the maximum number of items that can be stored in the vector
   without forcing a reallocation.

   The sole purpose of this function is to provide a means of fine tuning
   QVector's memory usage. In general, you will rarely ever need to call
   this function. If you want to know how many items are in the vector,
   call size().

   See also reserve() and squeeze().

  void QVector::clear ()

   Removes all the elements from the vector.

   Same as resize(0).

  const_iterator QVector::constBegin () const

   Returns a const STL-style iterator pointing to the first item in the
   vector.

   See also begin() and constEnd().

  const T * QVector::constData () const

   Returns a const pointer to the data stored in the vector. The pointer
   can be used to access the items in the vector. The pointer remains
   valid as long as the vector isn't reallocated.

   This function is mostly useful to pass a vector to a function that
   accepts a plain C++ array.

   See also data() and operator[]().

  const_iterator QVector::constEnd () const

   Returns a const STL-style iterator pointing to the imaginary item
   after the last item in the vector.

   See also constBegin() and end().

  bool QVector::contains ( const T & value ) const

   Returns true if the vector contains an occurrence of value; otherwise
   returns false.

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also indexOf() and count().

  int QVector::count ( const T & value ) const

   Returns the number of occurrences of value in the vector.

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also contains() and indexOf().

  int QVector::count () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Same as size().

  T * QVector::data ()

   Returns a pointer to the data stored in the vector. The pointer can be
   used to access and modify the items in the vector.

   Example:
    QVector<int> vector(10);
    int *data = vector.data();
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        data[i] = 2 * i;

   The pointer remains valid as long as the vector isn't reallocated.

   This function is mostly useful to pass a vector to a function that
   accepts a plain C++ array.

   See also constData() and operator[]().

  const T * QVector::data () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  bool QVector::empty () const

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   isEmpty().

  iterator QVector::end ()

   Returns an STL-style iterator pointing to the imaginary item after the
   last item in the vector.

   See also begin() and constEnd().

  const_iterator QVector::end () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  iterator QVector::erase ( iterator pos )

   Removes the item pointed to by the iterator pos from the vector, and
   returns an iterator to the next item in the vector (which may be
   end()).

   See also insert() and remove().

  iterator QVector::erase ( iterator begin, iterator end )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Removes all the items from begin up to (but not including) end.
   Returns an iterator to the same item that end referred to before the
   call.

  QVector & QVector::fill ( const T & value, int size = -1 )

   Assigns value to all items in the vector. If size is different from -1
   (the default), the vector is resized to size size beforehand.

   Example:
    QVector<QString> vector(3);
    vector.fill("Yes");
    // vector: ["Yes", "Yes", "Yes"]

    vector.fill("oh", 5);
    // vector: ["oh", "oh", "oh", "oh", "oh"]

   See also resize().

  T & QVector::first ()

   Returns a reference to the first item in the vector. This function
   assumes that the vector isn't empty.

   See also last() and isEmpty().

  const T & QVector::first () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QVector<T> QVector::fromList ( const QList<T> & list )   [static]

   Returns a QVector object with the data contained in list.

   Example:
    QStringList list;
    list << "Sven" << "Kim" << "Ola";

    QVector<QString> vect = QVector<QString>::fromList(list);
    // vect: ["Sven", "Kim", "Ola"]

   See also toList() and QList::toVector().

  QVector<T> QVector::fromStdVector ( const std::vector<T> & vector )
  [static]

   Returns a QVector object with the data contained in vector. The order
   of the elements in the QVector is the same as in vector.

   Example:
    std::vector<double> stdvector;
    vector.push_back(1.2);
    vector.push_back(0.5);
    vector.push_back(3.14);

    QVector<double> vector = QVector<double>::fromStdVector(stdvector);

   See also toStdVector() and QList::fromStdList().

  T & QVector::front ()

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   first().

  const_reference QVector::front () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  int QVector::indexOf ( const T & value, int from = 0 ) const

   Returns the index position of the first occurrence of value in the
   vector, searching forward from index position from. Returns -1 if no
   item matched.

   Example:
    QVector<QString> vector;
    vector << "A" << "B" << "C" << "B" << "A";
    vector.indexOf("B");            // returns 1
    vector.indexOf("B", 1);         // returns 1
    vector.indexOf("B", 2);         // returns 3
    vector.indexOf("X");            // returns -1

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also lastIndexOf() and contains().

  void QVector::insert ( int i, const T & value )

   Inserts value at index position i in the vector. If i is 0, the value
   is prepended to the vector. If i is size(), the value is appended to
   the vector.

   Example:
    QVector<QString> vector;
    vector << "alpha" << "beta" << "delta";
    vector.insert(2, "gamma");
    // vector: ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"]

   For large vectors, this operation can be slow (linear time), because
   it requires moving all the items at indexes i and above by one
   position further in memory. If you want a container class that
   provides a fast insert() function, use QLinkedList instead.

   See also append(), prepend(), and remove().

  iterator QVector::insert ( iterator before, int count, const T & value )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Inserts count copies of value in front of the item pointed to by the
   iterator before. Returns an iterator pointing at the first of the
   inserted items.

  void QVector::insert ( int i, int count, const T & value )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Inserts count copies of value at index position i in the vector.

   Example:
    QVector<double> vector;
    vector << 2.718 << 1.442 << 0.4342;
    vector.insert(1, 3, 9.9);
    // vector: [2.718, 9.9, 9.9, 9.9, 1.442, 0.4342]

  iterator QVector::insert ( iterator before, const T & value )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Inserts value in front of the item pointed to by the iterator before.
   Returns an iterator pointing at the inserted item.

  bool QVector::isEmpty () const

   Returns true if the vector has size 0; otherwise returns false.

   See also size() and resize().

  T & QVector::last ()

   Returns a reference to the last item in the vector. This function
   assumes that the vector isn't empty.

   See also first() and isEmpty().

  const T & QVector::last () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  int QVector::lastIndexOf ( const T & value, int from = -1 ) const

   Returns the index position of the last occurrence of the value value
   in the vector, searching backward from index position from. If from is
   -1 (the default), the search starts at the last item. Returns -1 if no
   item matched.

   Example:
    QList<QString> vector;
    vector << "A" << "B" << "C" << "B" << "A";
    vector.lastIndexOf("B");        // returns 3
    vector.lastIndexOf("B", 3);     // returns 3
    vector.lastIndexOf("B", 2);     // returns 1
    vector.lastIndexOf("X");        // returns -1

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also indexOf().

  QVector<T> QVector::mid ( int pos, int length = -1 ) const

   Returns a vector whose elements are copied from this vector, starting
   at position pos. If length is -1 (the default), all elements after pos
   are copied; otherwise length elements (or all remaining elements if
   there are less than length elements) are copied.

  void QVector::pop_back ()

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   erase(end() - 1).

  void QVector::pop_front ()

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   erase(begin()).

  void QVector::prepend ( const T & value )

   Inserts value at the beginning of the vector.

   Example:
    QVector<QString> vector;
    vector.prepend("one");
    vector.prepend("two");
    vector.prepend("three");
    // vector: ["three", "two", "one"]

   This is the same as vector.insert(0, value).

   For large vectors, this operation can be slow (linear time), because
   it requires moving all the items in the vector by one position further
   in memory. If you want a container class that provides a fast
   prepend() function, use QList or QLinkedList instead.

   See also append() and insert().

  void QVector::push_back ( const T & value )

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   append(value).

  void QVector::push_front ( const T & value )

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   prepend(value).

  void QVector::remove ( int i )

   Removes the element at index position i.

   See also insert(), replace(), and fill().

  void QVector::remove ( int i, int count )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Removes count elements from the middle of the vector, starting at
   index position i.

   See also insert(), replace(), and fill().

  void QVector::replace ( int i, const T & value )

   Replaces the item at index position i with value.

   i must be a valid index position in the vector (i.e., 0 <= i <
   size()).

   See also operator[]() and remove().

  void QVector::reserve ( int size )

   Attempts to allocate memory for at least size elements. If you know in
   advance how large the vector will be, you can call this function, and
   if you call resize() often you are likely to get better performance.
   If size is an underestimate, the worst that will happen is that the
   QVector will be a bit slower.

   The sole purpose of this function is to provide a means of fine tuning
   QVector's memory usage. In general, you will rarely ever need to call
   this function. If you want to change the size of the vector, call
   resize().

   See also squeeze() and capacity().

  void QVector::resize ( int size )

   Sets the size of the vector to size. If size is greater than the
   current size, elements are added to the end; the new elements are
   initialized with a default-constructed value. If size is less than the
   current size, elements are removed from the end.

   See also size().

  int QVector::size () const

   Returns the number of items in the vector.

   See also isEmpty() and resize().

  void QVector::squeeze ()

   Releases any memory not required to store the items.

   The sole purpose of this function is to provide a means of fine tuning
   QVector's memory usage. In general, you will rarely ever need to call
   this function.

   See also reserve() and capacity().

  QList<T> QVector::toList () const

   Returns a QList object with the data contained in this QVector.

   Example:
    QVector<double> vect;
    vect << "red" << "green" << "blue" << "black";

    QList<double> list = vect.toList();
    // list: ["red", "green", "blue", "black"]

   See also fromList() and QList::fromVector().

  std::vector<T> QVector::toStdVector () const

   Returns a std::vector object with the data contained in this QVector.
   Example:
    QVector<double> vector;
    vector << 1.2 << 0.5 << 3.14;

    std::vector<double> stdvector = vector.toStdVector();

   See also fromStdVector() and QList::toStdList().

  T QVector::value ( int i ) const

   Returns the value at index position i in the vector.

   If the index i is out of bounds, the function returns a
   default-constructed value. If you are certain that i is within bounds,
   you can use at() instead, which is slightly faster.

   See also at() and operator[]().

  T QVector::value ( int i, const T & defaultValue ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   If the index i is out of bounds, the function returns defaultValue.

  bool QVector::operator!= ( const QVector & other ) const

   Returns true if other is not equal to this vector; otherwise returns
   false.

   Two vectors are considered equal if they contain the same values in
   the same order.

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also operator==().

  QVector QVector::operator+ ( const QVector & other ) const

   Returns a vector that contains all the items in this vector followed
   by all the items in the other vector.

   See also operator+=().

  QVector & QVector::operator+= ( const QVector & other )

   Appends the items of the other vector to this vector and returns a
   reference to this vector.

   See also operator+() and append().

  QVector & QVector::operator+= ( const T & value )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Appends value to the vector.

   See also append() and operator<<().

  QVector & QVector::operator<< ( const T & value )

   Appends value to the vector and returns a reference to this vector.

   See also append() and operator+=().

  QVector & QVector::operator<< ( const QVector & other )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Appends other to the vector and returns a reference to the vector.

  QVector & QVector::operator= ( const QVector & other )

   Assigns other to this vector and returns a reference to this vector.

  bool QVector::operator== ( const QVector & other ) const

   Returns true if other is equal to this vector; otherwise returns
   false.

   Two vectors are considered equal if they contain the same values in
   the same order.

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also operator!=().

  T & QVector::operator[] ( int i )

   Returns the item at index position i as a modifiable reference.

   i must be a valid index position in the vector (i.e., 0 <= i <
   size()).

   See also at() and value().

  const T & QVector::operator[] ( int i ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Same as at(i).
