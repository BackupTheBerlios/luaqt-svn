Detailed Description

   The QPluginLoader class loads a plugin at run-time.

   QPlugingLoader provides a means for accessing a Qt plugin. Qt plugins
   are stored in a shared library (a "DLL") and follow offer a few
   benefits over plain shared libraries accessed using QLibrary:
     * Plugins offer safety in cases where a plugin is linked against
       different versions of Qt. (This typically would result in the
       application crashing when opening such a library with QLibrary.)
     * Plugin offers direct access to a root component object
       (instance()), instead of forcing you to resolve a C function
       manually.

   An instance of a QPluginLoader object operates on a single shared
   library file, which we call a plugin. It provides access to the
   functionality in the plugin in a platform-independent way. To specify
   which plugin to load, you can either pass a file name in the
   constructor or set it with setFileName().

   The most important functions are load() to dynamically load the plugin
   file, isLoaded() to check whether loading was successful, and
   instance() to access the root component in the plugin. The instance()
   function implicitly tries to load the plugin if it has not been loaded
   yet. Multiple instances of QPluginLoader can be used to access the
   same physical plugin.

   Once loaded, plugins remain in memory until the application
   terminates. You can attempt to unload a plugin using unload(), but if
   other instances of QPluginLoader are using the same library, the call
   will fail, and unloading will only happen when every instance has
   called unload().

   See How to Create Qt Plugins for more information about how to make
   your application extensible through plugins.

   See also QLibrary.

Property Documentation

  fileName : QString

   This property holds the file name of the plugin.

   To be loadable, the file's suffix must be a valid suffix for a
   loadable library in accordance with the platform, e.g. .so on Unix, -
   .dylib on Mac OS X, and .dll on Windows. The suffix can be verified
   with QLibrary::isLibrary().

   Access functions:
     * QString fileName () const
     * void setFileName ( const QString & fileName )

   See also load().

Member Function Documentation

  QPluginLoader::QPluginLoader ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a plugin loader with the given parent.

  QPluginLoader::QPluginLoader ( const QString & fileName, QObject * parent = 0
  )

   Constructs a plugin loader with the given parent that will load the
   plugin specified by fileName.

   To be loadable, the file's suffix must be a valid suffix for a
   loadable library in accordance with the platform, e.g. .so on Unix, -
   .dylib on Mac OS X, and .dll on Windows. The suffix can be verified
   with QLibrary::isLibrary().

   See also setFileName().

  QPluginLoader::~QPluginLoader ()

   Destroys the QPluginLoader object.

   Unless unload() was called explicitly, the plugin stays in memory
   until the application terminates.

   See also isLoaded() and unload().

  QObject * QPluginLoader::instance ()

   Returns the root component object of the plugin. The plugin is loaded
   if necessary. The function returns 0 if the plugin could not be loaded
   or if the root component object could not be instantiated.

   If the root component object was destroyed, calling this function
   creates a new instance.

   The instance is not deleted when the QPluginLoader is destroyed.

   The component object is a QObject. Use qobject_cast() to access
   interfaces you are interested in.

   See also load().

  bool QPluginLoader::isLoaded () const

   Returns true if the plugin is loaded; otherwise returns false.

   See also load().

  bool QPluginLoader::load ()

   Loads the plugin and returns true if the plugin was loaded
   successfully; otherwise returns false. Since instance() always calls
   this function before resolving any symbols it is not necessary to call
   it explicitly. In some situations you might want the plugin loaded in
   advance, in which case you would use this function.

   On Darwin and Mac OS X this function uses code from dlcompat, part of
   the OpenDarwin project.

  QObjectList QPluginLoader::staticInstances ()   [static]

  bool QPluginLoader::unload ()

   Unloads the plugin and returns true if the plugin could be unloaded;
   otherwise returns false.

   This happens automatically on application termination, so you
   shouldn't normally need to call this function.

   If other instances of QPluginLoader are using the same plugin, the
   call will fail, and unloading will only happen when every instance has
   called unload().

   See also instance() and load().

Macro Documentation

  Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE ( ClassName, Identifier )

   This macro associates the given Identifier (a string literal) to the
   interface class called ClassName.

   Example:
    Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(BrushInterface,
                        "com.trolltech.PlugAndPaint.BrushInterface/1.0")

   This macro is normally used right after the class definition for
   ClassName, in a header file. See the Plug & Paint example for details.

   See also Q_INTERFACE(), Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN(), and How to Create Qt
   Plugins.

  Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN ( ClassName )

   This macro exports the plugin class ClassName. There should be exactly
   one occurrence of this macro in a Qt plugin's source code (in an
   implementation file).

   Example:
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN(ExtraFiltersPlugin)

   See the Plug & Paint example for details.

   See also Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE() and How to Create Qt Plugins.
