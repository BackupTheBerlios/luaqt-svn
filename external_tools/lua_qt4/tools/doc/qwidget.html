Detailed Description

   The QWidget class is the base class of all user interface objects.

   The widget is the atom of the user interface: it receives mouse,
   keyboard and other events from the window system, and paints a
   representation of itself on the screen. Every widget is rectangular,
   and they are sorted in a Z-order. A widget is clipped by its parent
   and by the widgets in front of it.

   A widget that isn't embedded in a parent widget is called a window.
   Usually, windows have a frame and a title bar, although it is also
   possible to create windows without such decoration using suitable
   window flags). In Qt, QMainWindow and the various subclasses of
   QDialog are the most common window types.

   A widget without a parent widget is always an independent window.

   Non-window widgets are child widgets. These are child windows in their
   parent widgets. You cannot usually distinguish a child widget from its
   parent visually. Most other widgets in Qt are useful only as child
   widgets. (It is possible to make, say, a button into a window, but
   most people prefer to put their buttons inside other widgets, e.g.
   QDialog.)

   If you want to use a QWidget to hold child widgets you will probably
   want to add a layout to the parent QWidget. (See Layouts.)

   QWidget has many member functions, but some of them have little direct
   functionality: for example, QWidget has a font property, but never
   uses this itself. There are many subclasses which provide real
   functionality, such as QPushButton, QListWidget and QTabWidget, etc.

   Every widget's constructor accepts one or two standard arguments:
    1. QWidget *parent = 0 is the parent of the new widget. If it is 0
       (the default), the new widget will be a window. If not, it will be
       a child of parent, and be constrained by parent's geometry (unless
       you specify Qt::Window as window flag).
    2. Qt::WFlags f = 0 (where available) sets the window flags; the
       default is suitable for almost all widgets, but to get, for
       example, a window without a window system frame, you must use
       special flags.

   The widgets/calculator example program is good example of a simple
   widget. It contains event handlers (as all widgets must), routines
   that are specific to it (as all useful widgets do), and has children
   and connections. Everything it does is done in response to an event:
   this is by far the most common way to design GUI applications.

   You will need to supply the content for your widgets yourself, but
   here is a brief run-down of the events, starting with the most common
   ones:
     * paintEvent() - called whenever the widget needs to be repainted.
       Every widget which displays output must implement it. Painting
       using a QPainter can only take place in a paintEvent() or a
       function called by a paintEvent().
     * resizeEvent() - called when the widget has been resized.
     * mousePressEvent() - called when a mouse button is pressed. There
       are six mouse-related events, but the mouse press and mouse
       release events are by far the most important. A widget receives
       mouse press events when the mouse is inside it, or when it has
       grabbed the mouse using grabMouse().
     * mouseReleaseEvent() - called when a mouse button is released. A
       widget receives mouse release events when it has received the
       corresponding mouse press event. This means that if the user
       presses the mouse inside your widget, then drags the mouse to
       somewhere else, then releases, your widget receives the release
       event. There is one exception: if a popup menu appears while the
       mouse button is held down, this popup immediately steals the mouse
       events.
     * mouseDoubleClickEvent() - not quite as obvious as it might seem.
       If the user double-clicks, the widget receives a mouse press event
       (perhaps a mouse move event or two if they don't hold the mouse
       quite steady), a mouse release event and finally this event. It is
       not possible to distinguish a click from a double click until
       you've seen whether the second click arrives. (This is one reason
       why most GUI books recommend that double clicks be an extension of
       single clicks, rather than trigger a different action.)

   If your widget only contains child widgets, you probably do not need
   to implement any event handlers. If you want to detect a mouse click
   in a child widget call the child's underMouse() function inside the
   parent widget's mousePressEvent().

   Widgets that accept keyboard input need to reimplement a few more
   event handlers:
     * keyPressEvent() - called whenever a key is pressed, and again when
       a key has been held down long enough for it to auto-repeat. Note
       that the Tab and Shift+Tab keys are only passed to the widget if
       they are not used by the focus-change mechanisms. To force those
       keys to be processed by your widget, you must reimplement
       QWidget::event().
     * focusInEvent() - called when the widget gains keyboard focus
       (assuming you have called setFocusPolicy()). Well written widgets
       indicate that they own the keyboard focus in a clear but discreet
       way.
     * focusOutEvent() - called when the widget loses keyboard focus.

   Some widgets will also need to reimplement some of the less common
   event handlers:
     * mouseMoveEvent() - called whenever the mouse moves while a button
       is held down. This is useful for, for example, dragging. If you
       call setMouseTracking(true), you get mouse move events even when
       no buttons are held down. (See also the drag and drop
       information.)
     * keyReleaseEvent() - called whenever a key is released, and also
       while it is held down if the key is auto-repeating. In that case
       the widget receives a key release event and immediately a key
       press event for every repeat. Note that the Tab and Shift+Tab keys
       are only passed to the widget if they are not used by the
       focus-change mechanisms. To force those keys to be processed by
       your widget, you must reimplement QWidget::event().
     * wheelEvent() -- called whenever the user turns the mouse wheel
       while the widget has the focus.
     * enterEvent() - called when the mouse enters the widget's screen
       space. (This excludes screen space owned by any children of the
       widget.)
     * leaveEvent() - called when the mouse leaves the widget's screen
       space.
     * moveEvent() - called when the widget has been moved relative to
       its parent.
     * closeEvent() - called when the user closes the widget (or when
       close() is called).

   There are also some rather obscure events. They are listed in qevent.h
   and you need to reimplement event() to handle them. The default
   implementation of event() handles Tab and Shift+Tab (to move the
   keyboard focus), and passes on most other events to one of the more
   specialized handlers above.

   When implementing a widget, there are a few more things to consider.
     * In the constructor, be sure to set up your member variables early
       on, before there's any chance that you might receive an event.
     * It is almost always useful to reimplement sizeHint() and to set
       the correct size policy with setSizePolicy(), so users of your
       class can set up layout management more easily. A size policy lets
       you supply good defaults for the layout management handling, so
       that other widgets can contain and manage yours easily. sizeHint()
       indicates a "good" size for the widget.
     * If your widget is a window, setWindowTitle() and setWindowIcon()
       set the title bar and icon respectively.

   From Qt 4.0, QWidget automatically double-buffers its painting, so
   there's no need to write double-buffering code in paintEvent() to
   avoid flicker.

   See also QEvent, QPainter, QGridLayout, and QBoxLayout.

Property Documentation

  acceptDrops : bool

   This property holds whether drop events are enabled for this widget.

   Setting this property to true announces to the system that this widget
   may be able to accept drop events.

   If the widget is the desktop (QWidget::(windowType() == Qt::Desktop)),
   this may fail if another application is using the desktop; you can
   call acceptDrops() to test if this occurs.

   Warning: Do not modify this property in a Drag&Drop event handler.

   Access functions:
     * bool acceptDrops () const
     * void setAcceptDrops ( bool on )

  accessibleDescription : QString

   This property holds the widget's description as seen by assistive
   technologies.

   Access functions:
     * QString accessibleDescription () const
     * void setAccessibleDescription ( const QString & description )

   See also QAccessibleInterface::text().

  accessibleName : QString

   This property holds the widget's name as seen by assistive
   technologies.

   Access functions:
     * QString accessibleName () const
     * void setAccessibleName ( const QString & name )

   See also QAccessibleInterface::text().

  baseSize : QSize

   This property holds the base size of the widget.

   The base size is used to calculate a proper widget size if the widget
   defines sizeIncrement().

   Access functions:
     * QSize baseSize () const
     * void setBaseSize ( const QSize & )
     * void setBaseSize ( int basew, int baseh )

   See also setSizeIncrement().

  childrenRect : const QRect

   This property holds the bounding rectangle of the widget's children.

   Hidden children are excluded.

   Access functions:
     * QRect childrenRect () const

   See also childrenRegion() and geometry().

  childrenRegion : const QRegion

   This property holds the combined region occupied by the widget's
   children.

   Hidden children are excluded.

   Access functions:
     * QRegion childrenRegion () const

   See also childrenRect() and geometry().

  contextMenuPolicy : Qt::ContextMenuPolicy

   This property holds how the widget shows a context menu.

   The default value of this property is Qt::DefaultContextMenu, which
   means the contextMenuEvent() handler is called. Other values are
   Qt::NoContextMenu, Qt::ActionsContextMenu, and Qt::CustomContextMenu.
   With Qt::CustomContextMenu, the signal customContextMenuRequested() is
   emitted.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::ContextMenuPolicy contextMenuPolicy () const
     * void setContextMenuPolicy ( Qt::ContextMenuPolicy policy )

   See also contextMenuEvent() and customContextMenuRequested().

  cursor : QCursor

   This property holds the cursor shape for this widget.

   The mouse cursor will assume this shape when it's over this widget.
   See the list of predefined cursor objects for a range of useful
   shapes.

   An editor widget might use an I-beam cursor:
    setCursor(Qt::IBeamCursor);

   If no cursor has been set, or after a call to unsetCursor(), the
   parent's cursor is used. The function unsetCursor() has no effect on
   windows.

   Access functions:
     * QCursor cursor () const
     * void setCursor ( const QCursor & )
     * void unsetCursor ()

   See also QApplication::setOverrideCursor().

  enabled : bool

   This property holds whether the widget is enabled.

   An enabled widget handles keyboard and mouse events; a disabled widget
   does not.

   Some widgets display themselves differently when they are disabled.
   For example a button might draw its label grayed out. If your widget
   needs to know when it becomes enabled or disabled, you can use the
   changeEvent() with type QEvent::EnabledChange.

   Disabling a widget implicitly disables all its children. Enabling
   respectively enables all child widgets unless they have been
   explicitly disabled.

   Access functions:
     * bool isEnabled () const
     * void setEnabled ( bool )

   See also isEnabledTo(), QKeyEvent, QMouseEvent, and changeEvent().

  focus : const bool

   This property holds whether this widget (or its focus proxy) has the
   keyboard input focus.

   Effectively equivalent to QApplication::focusWidget() == this.

   Access functions:
     * bool hasFocus () const

   See also setFocus(), clearFocus(), setFocusPolicy(), and
   QApplication::focusWidget().

  focusPolicy : Qt::FocusPolicy

   This property holds the way the widget accepts keyboard focus.

   The policy is Qt::TabFocus if the widget accepts keyboard focus by
   tabbing, Qt::ClickFocus if the widget accepts focus by clicking,
   Qt::StrongFocus if it accepts both, and Qt::NoFocus (the default) if
   it does not accept focus at all.

   You must enable keyboard focus for a widget if it processes keyboard
   events. This is normally done from the widget's constructor. For
   instance, the QLineEdit constructor calls
   setFocusPolicy(Qt::StrongFocus).

   Access functions:
     * Qt::FocusPolicy focusPolicy () const
     * void setFocusPolicy ( Qt::FocusPolicy policy )

   See also focusInEvent(), focusOutEvent(), keyPressEvent(),
   keyReleaseEvent(), and enabled.

  font : QFont

   This property holds the font currently set for the widget.

   The fontInfo() function reports the actual font that is being used by
   the widget.

   As long as no special font has been set, or after setFont(QFont()) is
   called, this is either a special font for the widget class, the
   parent's font or (if this widget is a top level widget), the default
   application font.

   This code fragment sets a 12 point helvetica bold font:
    QFont f("Helvetica", 12, QFont::Bold);
    setFont(f);

   In addition to setting the font, setFont() informs all children about
   the change.

   Access functions:
     * const QFont & font () const
     * void setFont ( const QFont & )

   See also fontInfo() and fontMetrics().

  frameGeometry : const QRect

   This property holds geometry of the widget relative to its parent
   including any window frame.

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of geometry
   issues with windows.

   Access functions:
     * QRect frameGeometry () const

   See also geometry(), x(), y(), and pos().

  frameSize : const QSize

   This property holds the size of the widget including any window frame.

   Access functions:
     * QSize frameSize () const

  fullScreen : const bool

   This property holds whether the widget is full screen.

   Access functions:
     * bool isFullScreen () const

   See also windowState(), minimized, and maximized.

  geometry : QRect

   This property holds the geometry of the widget relative to its parent
   and excluding the window frame.

   When changing the geometry, the widget, if visible, receives a move
   event (moveEvent()) and/or a resize event (resizeEvent()) immediately.
   If the widget is not currently visible, it is guaranteed to receive
   appropriate events before it is shown.

   The size component is adjusted if it lies outside the range defined by
   minimumSize() and maximumSize().

   Warning: Calling setGeometry() inside resizeEvent() or moveEvent() can
   lead to infinite recursion.

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of window
   geometry.

   Access functions:
     * const QRect & geometry () const
     * void setGeometry ( int x, int y, int w, int h )
     * void setGeometry ( const QRect & )

   See also frameGeometry(), rect(), move(), resize(), moveEvent(),
   resizeEvent(), minimumSize(), and maximumSize().

  height : const int

   This property holds the height of the widget excluding any window
   frame.

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of window
   geometry.

   Access functions:
     * int height () const

   See also geometry, width, and size.

  isActiveWindow : const bool

   This property holds whether this widget's window is the active window.

   The active window is the window that contains the widget that has
   keyboard focus.

   When popup windows are visible, this property is true for both the
   active window and for the popup.

   Access functions:
     * bool isActiveWindow () const

   See also activateWindow() and QApplication::activeWindow().

  layoutDirection : Qt::LayoutDirection

   This property holds the layout direction for this widget.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::LayoutDirection layoutDirection () const
     * void setLayoutDirection ( Qt::LayoutDirection direction )
     * void unsetLayoutDirection ()

   See also QApplication::layoutDirection.

  maximized : const bool

   This property holds whether this widget is maximized.

   This property is only relevant for windows.

   Note that due to limitations in some window-systems, this does not
   always report the expected results (e.g. if the user on X11 maximizes
   the window via the window manager, Qt has no way of distinguishing
   this from any other resize). This is expected to improve as window
   manager protocols evolve.

   Access functions:
     * bool isMaximized () const

   See also windowState(), showMaximized(), visible, show(), hide(),
   showNormal(), and minimized.

  maximumHeight : int

   This property holds the widget's maximum height.

   This property corresponds to maximumSize().height().

   Access functions:
     * int maximumHeight () const
     * void setMaximumHeight ( int maxh )

   See also maximumSize and maximumWidth.

  maximumSize : QSize

   This property holds the widget's maximum size.

   The widget cannot be resized to a larger size than the maximum widget
   size.

   Access functions:
     * QSize maximumSize () const
     * void setMaximumSize ( const QSize & )
     * void setMaximumSize ( int maxw, int maxh )

   See also maximumWidth, maximumHeight, minimumSize, and sizeIncrement.

  maximumWidth : int

   This property holds the widget's maximum width.

   This property corresponds to maximumSize().width().

   Access functions:
     * int maximumWidth () const
     * void setMaximumWidth ( int maxw )

   See also maximumSize and maximumHeight.

  minimized : const bool

   This property holds whether this widget is minimized (iconified).

   This property is only relevant for windows.

   Access functions:
     * bool isMinimized () const

   See also showMinimized(), visible, show(), hide(), showNormal(), and
   maximized.

  minimumHeight : int

   This property holds the widget's minimum height.

   This property corresponds to minimumSize().height().

   Access functions:
     * int minimumHeight () const
     * void setMinimumHeight ( int minh )

   See also minimumSize and minimumWidth.

  minimumSize : QSize

   This property holds the widget's minimum size.

   The widget cannot be resized to a smaller size than the minimum widget
   size. The widget's size is forced to the minimum size if the current
   size is smaller.

   The minimum size set by this function will override the minimum size
   defined by QLayout.

   Access functions:
     * QSize minimumSize () const
     * void setMinimumSize ( const QSize & )
     * void setMinimumSize ( int minw, int minh )

   See also minimumWidth, minimumHeight, maximumSize, and sizeIncrement.

  minimumSizeHint : const QSize

   This property holds the recommended minimum size for the widget.

   If the value of this property is an invalid size, no minimum size is
   recommended.

   The default implementation of minimumSizeHint() returns an invalid
   size if there is no layout for this widget, and returns the layout's
   minimum size otherwise. Most built-in widgets reimplement
   minimumSizeHint().

   QLayout will never resize a widget to a size smaller than the minimum
   size hint unless minimumSize() is set or the size policy is set to
   QSizePolicy::Ignore. If minimumSize() is set, the minimum size hint
   will be ignored.

   Access functions:
     * virtual QSize minimumSizeHint () const

   See also QSize::isValid(), resize(), setMinimumSize(), and
   sizePolicy().

  minimumWidth : int

   This property holds the widget's minimum width.

   This property corresponds to minimumSize().width().

   Access functions:
     * int minimumWidth () const
     * void setMinimumWidth ( int minw )

   See also minimumSize and minimumHeight.

  modal : const bool

   This property holds whether the widget is a modal widget.

   This property only makes sense for windows. A modal widget prevents
   widgets in all other windows from getting any input.

   Access functions:
     * bool isModal () const

   See also isWindow() and QDialog.

  mouseTracking : bool

   This property holds whether mouse tracking is enabled for the widget.

   If mouse tracking is disabled (the default), the widget only receives
   mouse move events when at least one mouse button is pressed while the
   mouse is being moved.

   If mouse tracking is enabled, the widget receives mouse move events
   even if no buttons are pressed.

   Access functions:
     * bool hasMouseTracking () const
     * void setMouseTracking ( bool enable )

   See also mouseMoveEvent().

  normalGeometry : const QRect

   This property holds the geometry a toplevel widget has when it is not
   maximized or fullscreen.

   For child widgets this property always holds an empty rect.

   Access functions:
     * QRect normalGeometry () const

   See also QWidget::windowState() and QWidget::geometry.

  palette : QPalette

   This property holds the widget's palette.

   As long as no special palette has been set, this is either a special
   palette for the widget class, the parent's palette or (if this widget
   is a top level widget), the default application palette.

   Access functions:
     * const QPalette & palette () const
     * void setPalette ( const QPalette & )

   See also QApplication::palette().

  pos : QPoint

   This property holds the position of the widget within its parent
   widget.

   If the widget is a window, the position is that of the widget on the
   desktop, including its frame.

   When changing the position, the widget, if visible, receives a move
   event (moveEvent()) immediately. If the widget is not currently
   visible, it is guaranteed to receive an event before it is shown.

   move() is virtual, and all other overloaded move() implementations in
   Qt call it.

   Warning: Calling move() or setGeometry() inside moveEvent() can lead
   to infinite recursion.

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of window
   geometry.

   Access functions:
     * QPoint pos () const
     * void move ( int x, int y )
     * void move ( const QPoint & )

   See also frameGeometry, size, x(), and y().

  rect : const QRect

   This property holds the internal geometry of the widget excluding any
   window frame.

   The rect property equals QRect(0, 0, width(), height()).

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of window
   geometry.

   Access functions:
     * QRect rect () const

   See also size.

  size : QSize

   This property holds the size of the widget excluding any window frame.

   If the widget is visible when it is being resized, it receives a
   resize event (resizeEvent()) immediately. If the widget is not
   currently visible, it is guaranteed to receive an event before it is
   shown.

   The size is adjusted if it lies outside the range defined by
   minimumSize() and maximumSize(). For windows, the minimum size is
   always at least QSize(1, 1), and it might be larger, depending on the
   window manager.

   Warning: Calling resize() or setGeometry() inside resizeEvent() can
   lead to infinite recursion.

   Access functions:
     * QSize size () const
     * void resize ( int w, int h )
     * void resize ( const QSize & )

   See also pos, geometry, minimumSize, maximumSize, and resizeEvent().

  sizeHint : const QSize

   This property holds the recommended size for the widget.

   If the value of this property is an invalid size, no size is
   recommended.

   The default implementation of sizeHint() returns an invalid size if
   there is no layout for this widget, and returns the layout's preferred
   size otherwise.

   Access functions:
     * virtual QSize sizeHint () const

   See also QSize::isValid(), minimumSizeHint(), sizePolicy(),
   setMinimumSize(), and updateGeometry().

  sizeIncrement : QSize

   This property holds the size increment of the widget.

   When the user resizes the window, the size will move in steps of
   sizeIncrement().width() pixels horizontally and sizeIncrement.height()
   pixels vertically, with baseSize() as the basis. Preferred widget
   sizes are for non-negative integers i and j:
    width = baseSize().width() + i * sizeIncrement().width();
    height = baseSize().height() + j * sizeIncrement().height();

   Note that while you can set the size increment for all widgets, it
   only affects windows.

   Warning: The size increment has no effect under Windows, and may be
   disregarded by the window manager on X.

   Access functions:
     * QSize sizeIncrement () const
     * void setSizeIncrement ( const QSize & )
     * void setSizeIncrement ( int w, int h )

   See also size, minimumSize, and maximumSize.

  sizePolicy : QSizePolicy

   This property holds the default layout behavior of the widget.

   If there is a QLayout that manages this widget's children, the size
   policy specified by that layout is used. If there is no such QLayout,
   the result of this function is used.

   The default policy is Preferred/Preferred, which means that the widget
   can be freely resized, but prefers to be the size sizeHint() returns.
   Button-like widgets set the size policy to specify that they may
   stretch horizontally, but are fixed vertically. The same applies to
   lineedit controls (such as QLineEdit, QSpinBox or an editable
   QComboBox) and other horizontally orientated widgets (such as
   QProgressBar). QToolButton's are normally square, so they allow growth
   in both directions. Widgets that support different directions (such as
   QSlider, QScrollBar or QHeader) specify stretching in the respective
   direction only. Widgets that can provide scrollbars (usually
   subclasses of QScrollView) tend to specify that they can use
   additional space, and that they can make do with less than sizeHint().

   Access functions:
     * QSizePolicy sizePolicy () const
     * void setSizePolicy ( QSizePolicy )
     * void setSizePolicy ( QSizePolicy::Policy horizontal,
       QSizePolicy::Policy vertical )

   See also sizeHint(), QLayout, QSizePolicy, and updateGeometry().

  statusTip : QString

   This property holds the widget's status tip.

   Access functions:
     * QString statusTip () const
     * void setStatusTip ( const QString & )

   See also toolTip and whatsThis.

  toolTip : QString

   This property holds the widget's tooltip.

   Access functions:
     * QString toolTip () const
     * void setToolTip ( const QString & )

   See also QToolTip, statusTip, and whatsThis.

  updatesEnabled : bool

   This property holds whether updates are enabled.

   An updates enabled widget receives paint events and has a system
   background; a disabled widget does not. This also implies that calling
   update() and repaint() has no effect if updates are disabled.

   setUpdatesEnabled() is normally used to disable updates for a short
   period of time, for instance to avoid screen flicker during large
   changes. In Qt, widgets normally do not generate screen flicker, but
   on X11 the server might erase regions on the screen when widgets get
   hidden before they can be replaced by other widgets. Disabling updates
   solves this.

   Example:
    setUpdatesEnabled(false);
    bigVisualChanges();
    setUpdatesEnabled(true);

   Disabling a widget implicitly disables all its children. Enabling
   respectively enables all child widgets unless they have been
   explicitly disabled. Re-enabling updates implicitly calls update() on
   the widget.

   Access functions:
     * bool updatesEnabled () const
     * void setUpdatesEnabled ( bool enable )

   See also paintEvent().

  visible : bool

   This property holds whether the widget is visible.

   Calling setVisible(true) or show() sets the widget to visible status
   if all its parent widgets up to the window are visible. If an ancestor
   is not visible, the widget won't become visible until all its
   ancestors are shown. If its size or position has changed, Qt
   guarantees that a widget gets move and resize events just before it is
   shown. If the widget has not been resized yet, Qt will adjust the
   widget's size to a useful default using adjustSize().

   Calling setVisible(false) or hide() hides a widget explicitly. An
   explicitly hidden widget will never become visible, even if all its
   ancestors become visible, unless you show it.

   A widget receives show and hide events when its visibility status
   changes. Between a hide and a show event, there is no need to waste
   CPU cycles preparing or displaying information to the user. A video
   application, for example, might simply stop generating new frames.

   A widget that happens to be obscured by other windows on the screen is
   considered to be visible. The same applies to iconified windows and
   windows that exist on another virtual desktop (on platforms that
   support this concept). A widget receives spontaneous show and hide
   events when its mapping status is changed by the window system, e.g. a
   spontaneous hide event when the user minimizes the window, and a
   spontaneous show event when the window is restored again.

   You almost never have to reimplement the setVisible() function. If you
   need to change some settings before a widget is shown, use showEvent()
   instead. If you need to do some delayed initialization use the Polish
   event delivered to the event() method

   Access functions:
     * bool isVisible () const
     * virtual void setVisible ( bool visible )

   See also show(), hide(), isHidden(), isVisibleTo(), isMinimized(),
   showEvent(), and hideEvent().

  whatsThis : QString

   This property holds the widget's What's This help text.

   Access functions:
     * QString whatsThis () const
     * void setWhatsThis ( const QString & )

   See also QWhatsThis, QWidget::toolTip, and QWidget::statusTip.

  width : const int

   This property holds the width of the widget excluding any window
   frame.

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of window
   geometry.

   Access functions:
     * int width () const

   See also geometry, height, and size.

  windowFlags : Qt::WindowFlags

   Window flags are a combination of a type (e.g. Qt::Dialog) and zero or
   more hints to the window system (e.g. Qt::FramelessWindowHint).

   If the widget had type Qt::Widget or Qt::SubWindow and becomes a
   window (Qt::Window, Qt::Dialog, etc.), it is put at position (0, 0) on
   the desktop. If the widget is a window and becomes a Qt::Widget or
   Qt::SubWindow, it is put at position (0, 0) relative to its parent
   widget.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::WindowFlags windowFlags () const
     * void setWindowFlags ( Qt::WindowFlags type )

   See also windowType().

  windowIcon : QIcon

   This property holds the widget's icon.

   This property only makes sense for windows. If no icon has been set,
   windowIcon() returns the application icon
   (QApplication::windowIcon()).

   Access functions:
     * QIcon windowIcon () const
     * void setWindowIcon ( const QIcon & icon )

   See also windowIconText and windowTitle.

  windowIconText : QString

   This property holds the widget's icon text.

   This property only makes sense for windows. If no icon text has been
   set, this functions returns an empty string.

   Access functions:
     * QString windowIconText () const
     * void setWindowIconText ( const QString & )

   See also windowIcon and windowTitle.

  windowModified : bool

   This property holds whether the document shown in the window has
   unsaved changes.

   A modified window is a window whose content has changed but has not
   been saved to disk. This flag will have different effects varied by
   the platform. On Mac OS X the close button will have a modified look;
   on other platforms, the window title will have an '*' (asterisk).

   The window title must contain a "[*]" placeholder, which indicates
   where the '*' should appear. Normally, it should appear right after
   the file name (e.g., "document1.txt[*] - Text Editor"). If the window
   isn't modified, the placeholder is simply removed.

   Access functions:
     * bool isWindowModified () const
     * void setWindowModified ( bool )

   See also windowTitle.

  windowOpacity : double

   This property holds the level of opacity for the window.

   The valid range of opacity is from 1.0 (completely opaque) to 0.0
   (completely transparent).

   By default the value of this property is 1.0.

   This feature is only present on Mac OS X and Windows 2000 and up.

   Warning: Changing this property from opaque to transparent might issue
   a paint event that needs to be processed before the window is
   displayed correctly. This affects mainly the use of
   QPixmap::grabWindow(). Also note that semi-transparent windows update
   and resize significantly slower than opaque windows.

   Access functions:
     * qreal windowOpacity () const
     * void setWindowOpacity ( qreal level )

  windowTitle : QString

   This property holds the window title (caption).

   This property only makes sense for windows. If no caption has been
   set, the title is an empty string.

   If you use the windowModified mechanism, the window title must contain
   a "[*]" placeholder, which indicates where the '*' should appear.
   Normally, it should appear right after the file name (e.g.,
   "document1.txt[*] - Text Editor"). If the windowModified property is
   false (the default), the placeholder is simply removed.

   Access functions:
     * QString windowTitle () const
     * void setWindowTitle ( const QString & )

   See also windowIcon, windowIconText, and windowModified.

  x : const int

   This property holds the x coordinate of the widget relative to its
   parent including any window frame.

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of window
   geometry.

   Access functions:
     * int x () const

   See also frameGeometry, y, and pos.

  y : const int

   This property holds the y coordinate of the widget relative to its
   parent and including any window frame.

   See the Window Geometry documentation for an overview of window
   geometry.

   Access functions:
     * int y () const

   See also frameGeometry, x, and pos.
     _________________________________________________________________

Member Function Documentation

  QWidget::QWidget ( QWidget * parent = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   Constructs a widget which is a child of parent, with widget flags set
   to f.

   If parent is 0, the new widget becomes a window. If parent is another
   widget, this widget becomes a child window inside parent. The new
   widget is deleted when its parent is deleted.

   The widget flags argument, f, is normally 0, but it can be set to
   customize the frame of a window (i.e. parent must be 0). To customize
   the frame, use a value composed from the bitwise OR of any of the
   window flags.

   If you add a child widget to an already visible widget you must
   explicitly show the child to make it visible.

   Note that the X11 version of Qt may not be able to deliver all
   combinations of style flags on all systems. This is because on X11, Qt
   can only ask the window manager, and the window manager can override
   the application's settings. On Windows, Qt can set whatever flags you
   want.

  QWidget::~QWidget ()

   Destroys the widget.

   All this widget's children are deleted first. The application exits if
   this widget is the main widget.

  void QWidget::actionEvent ( QActionEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler is called with the given event whenever the
   widget's actions are changed.

   See also addAction(), insertAction(), removeAction(), actions(), and
   QActionEvent.

  QList<QAction *> QWidget::actions () const

   Returns the (possibly empty) list of this widget's actions.

  void QWidget::activateWindow ()

   Sets the top-level widget containing this widget to be the active
   window.

   An active window is a visible top-level window that has the keyboard
   input focus.

   This function performs the same operation as clicking the mouse on the
   title bar of a top-level window. On X11, the result depends on the
   Window Manager. If you want to ensure that the window is stacked on
   top as well you should also call raise(). Note that the window must be
   visible, otherwise activateWindow() has no effect.

   On Windows, if you are calling this when the application is not
   currently the active one then it will not make it the active window.
   It will flash the task bar entry blue to indicate that the window has
   done something. This is because Microsoft do not allow an application
   to interrupt what the user is currently doing in another application.

   See also isActiveWindow(), window(), and show().

  void QWidget::addAction ( QAction * action )

   Appends the action action to this widget's list of actions.

   All QWidgets have list of QActions, however they can be represented
   graphically in many different ways. The default use of the QAction
   list (as returned by actions()) is to create a context QMenu.

   See also removeAction() and QMenu.

  void QWidget::addActions ( QList<QAction *> actions )

   Appends the actions actions to this widget's list of actions.

   See also removeAction(), QMenu, and addAction().

  void QWidget::adjustSize ()

   Adjusts the size of the widget to fit the contents.

   Uses sizeHint() if valid (i.e if the size hint's width and height are
   >= 0), otherwise sets the size to the children rectangle (the union of
   all child widget geometries). For toplevel widgets, the function also
   takes the screen size into account.

   See also sizeHint() and childrenRect().

  QPalette::ColorRole QWidget::backgroundRole () const

   Returns the background role of the widget.

   The background role defines the brush from the widget's palette that
   is used to render the background.

   If no explicit background role is set, the widget inherts its parent
   widget's background role.

   See also setBackgroundRole() and foregroundRole().

  void QWidget::changeEvent ( QEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented to handle state changes.

   The state being changed in this event can be retrieved through event
   e.

  QWidget * QWidget::childAt ( int x, int y ) const

   Returns the visible child widget at the position (x, y) in the
   widget's coordinate system. If there is no visible child widget at the
   specified position, the function returns 0.

  QWidget * QWidget::childAt ( const QPoint & p ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the visible child widget at point p in the widget's own
   coordinate system.

  void QWidget::clearFocus ()

   Takes keyboard input focus from the widget.

   If the widget has active focus, a focus out event is sent to this
   widget to tell it that it is about to lose the focus.

   This widget must enable focus setting in order to get the keyboard
   input focus, i.e. it must call setFocusPolicy().

   See also hasFocus(), setFocus(), focusInEvent(), focusOutEvent(),
   setFocusPolicy(), and QApplication::focusWidget().

  void QWidget::clearMask ()

   Removes any mask set by setMask().

   See also setMask().

  bool QWidget::close ()   [slot]

   Closes this widget. Returns true if the widget was closed; otherwise
   returns false.

   First it sends the widget a QCloseEvent. The widget is hidden if it
   accepts the close event. If it ignores the event, nothing happens. The
   default implementation of QWidget::closeEvent() accepts the close
   event.

   If the widget has the Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose flag, the widget is also
   deleted. A close events is delivered to the widget no matter if the
   widget is visible or not.

   The QApplication::lastWindowClosed() signal is emitted when the last
   visible top level widget with the Qt::WA_QuitOnClose attribute set is
   closed. By default this attribute is set for all widgets except
   transient top level widgets such as splash screens, popup menus, and
   dialogs.

  void QWidget::closeEvent ( QCloseEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive widget close events.

   See also event(), hide(), close(), and QCloseEvent.

  QRect QWidget::contentsRect () const

   Returns the area inside the widget's margins.

   See also setContentsMargins() and getContentsMargins().

  void QWidget::contextMenuEvent ( QContextMenuEvent * e )   [virtual
  protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive widget context menu events.

   The handler is called when the widget's contextMenuPolicy is
   Qt::DefaultContextMenu.

   The default implementation calls e->ignore(), which rejects the
   context event. See the QContextMenuEvent documentation for more
   details.

   See also event(), QContextMenuEvent, and customContextMenuRequested().

  void QWidget::create ( WId window = 0, bool initializeWindow = true, bool
  destroyOldWindow = true )   [protected]

   Creates a new widget window if window is 0, otherwise sets the
   widget's window to window.

   Initializes the window (sets the geometry etc.) if initializeWindow is
   true. If initializeWindow is false, no initialization is performed.
   This parameter only makes sense if window is a valid window.

   Destroys the old window if destroyOldWindow is true. If
   destroyOldWindow is false, you are responsible for destroying the
   window yourself (using platform native code).

   The QWidget constructor calls create(0,true,true) to create a window
   for this widget.

  void QWidget::customContextMenuRequested ( const QPoint & pos )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the widget's contextMenuPolicy is
   Qt::CustomContextMenu, and the user has requested a context menu on
   the widget. The position pos is the position of the request in widget
   coordinates.

   See also mapToGlobal(), QMenu, and contextMenuPolicy.

  void QWidget::destroy ( bool destroyWindow = true, bool destroySubWindows =
  true )   [protected]

   Frees up window system resources. Destroys the widget window if
   destroyWindow is true.

   destroy() calls itself recursively for all the child widgets, passing
   destroySubWindows for the destroyWindow parameter. To have more
   control over destruction of subwidgets, destroy subwidgets selectively
   first.

   This function is usually called from the QWidget destructor.

  void QWidget::dragEnterEvent ( QDragEnterEvent * event )   [virtual
  protected]

   This event handler is called when a drag is in progress and the mouse
   enters this widget. The event is passed in the event parameter.

   See the Drag-and-drop documentation for an overview of how to provide
   drag-and-drop in your application.

   See also QTextDrag, QImageDrag, and QDragEnterEvent.

  void QWidget::dragLeaveEvent ( QDragLeaveEvent * event )   [virtual
  protected]

   This event handler is called when a drag is in progress and the mouse
   leaves this widget. The event is passed in the event parameter.

   See the Drag-and-drop documentation for an overview of how to provide
   drag-and-drop in your application.

   See also QTextDrag, QImageDrag, and QDragLeaveEvent.

  void QWidget::dragMoveEvent ( QDragMoveEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler is called if a drag is in progress, and when any of
   the following conditions occurs: the cursor enters this widget, the
   cursor moves within this widget, or a modifier key is pressed on the
   keyboard while this widget has the focus. The event is passed in the
   event parameter.

   See the Drag-and-drop documentation for an overview of how to provide
   drag-and-drop in your application.

   See also QTextDrag, QImageDrag, and QDragMoveEvent.

  void QWidget::dropEvent ( QDropEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler is called when the drag is dropped on this widget
   which are passed in the event parameter.

   See the Drag-and-drop documentation for an overview of how to provide
   drag-and-drop in your application.

   See also QTextDrag, QImageDrag, and QDropEvent.

  void QWidget::ensurePolished () const

   Ensures that the widget has been polished by QStyle (i.e., has a
   proper font and palette).

   QWidget calls this function after it has been fully constructed but
   before it is shown the very first time. You can call this function if
   you want to ensure that the widget is polished before doing an
   operation (e.g., the correct font size might be needed in the widget's
   sizeHint() reimplementation).

   Polishing is useful for final initialization that must happen after
   all constructors (from base classes as well as from subclasses) have
   been called.

   If you need to change some settings when a widget is polished,
   reimplement event() and handle the QEvent::Polish event type.

   Note: The function is declared const so that it can be called from
   other const functions (e.g., sizeHint()).

   See also event().

  void QWidget::enterEvent ( QEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   widget enter events which are passed in the event parameter.

   An event is sent to the widget when the mouse cursor enters the
   widget.

   See also leaveEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(), and event().

  bool QWidget::event ( QEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This is the main event handler; it handles event e. You can
   reimplement this function in a subclass, but we recommend using one of
   the specialized event handlers instead.

   Key press and release events are treated differently from other
   events. event() checks for Tab and Shift+Tab and tries to move the
   focus appropriately. If there is no widget to move the focus to (or
   the key press is not Tab or Shift+Tab), event() calls keyPressEvent().

   Mouse and tablet event handling is also slightly special: only when
   the widget is enabled, event() will call the specialized handlers such
   as mousePressEvent(); otherwise it will discard the event.

   This function returns true if the event was recognized, otherwise it
   returns false. If the recognized event was accepted (see
   QEvent::accepted), any further processing such as event propagation to
   the parent widget stops.

   Reimplemented from QObject.

   See also closeEvent(), focusInEvent(), focusOutEvent(), enterEvent(),
   keyPressEvent(), keyReleaseEvent(), leaveEvent(),
   mouseDoubleClickEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(), mousePressEvent(),
   mouseReleaseEvent(), moveEvent(), paintEvent(), resizeEvent(),
   QObject::event(), and QObject::timerEvent().

  QWidget * QWidget::find ( WId id )   [static]

   Returns a pointer to the widget with window identifer/handle id.

   The window identifier type depends on the underlying window system,
   see qwindowdefs.h for the actual definition. If there is no widget
   with this identifier, 0 is returned.

  void QWidget::focusInEvent ( QFocusEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   keyboard focus events (focus received) for the widget. The event is
   passed in the event parameter

   A widget normally must setFocusPolicy() to something other than
   Qt::NoFocus in order to receive focus events. (Note that the
   application programmer can call setFocus() on any widget, even those
   that do not normally accept focus.)

   The default implementation updates the widget (except for windows that
   do not specify a focusPolicy()).

   See also focusOutEvent(), setFocusPolicy(), keyPressEvent(),
   keyReleaseEvent(), event(), and QFocusEvent.

  bool QWidget::focusNextChild ()   [protected]

   Finds a new widget to give the keyboard focus to, as appropriate for
   Tab, and returns true if it can find a new widget, or false if it
   can't.

   This is the same as focusNextPrevChild(true).

   See also focusPreviousChild().

  bool QWidget::focusNextPrevChild ( bool next )   [virtual protected]

   Finds a new widget to give the keyboard focus to, as appropriate for
   Tab and Shift+Tab, and returns true if it can find a new widget, or
   false if it can't.

   If next is true, this function searches "forwards", if next is false,
   it searches "backwards".

   Sometimes, you will want to reimplement this function. For example, a
   web browser might reimplement it to move its "current active link"
   forward or backward, and call focusNextPrevChild() only when it
   reaches the last or first link on the "page".

   Child widgets call focusNextPrevChild() on their parent widgets, but
   only the window that contains the child widgets decides where to
   redirect focus. By reimplementing this function for an object, you
   thus gain control of focus traversal for all child widgets.

   See also focusNextChild() and focusPreviousChild().

  void QWidget::focusOutEvent ( QFocusEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   keyboard focus events (focus lost) for the widget. The events is
   passed in the event parameter.

   A widget normally must setFocusPolicy() to something other than
   Qt::NoFocus in order to receive focus events. (Note that the
   application programmer can call setFocus() on any widget, even those
   that do not normally accept focus.)

   The default implementation updates the widget (except for windows that
   do not specify a focusPolicy()).

   See also focusInEvent(), setFocusPolicy(), keyPressEvent(),
   keyReleaseEvent(), event(), and QFocusEvent.

  bool QWidget::focusPreviousChild ()   [protected]

   Finds a new widget to give the keyboard focus to, as appropriate for
   Shift+Tab, and returns true if it can find a new widget, or false if
   it can't.

   This is the same as focusNextPrevChild(false).

   See also focusNextChild().

  QWidget * QWidget::focusProxy () const

   Returns the focus proxy, or 0 if there is no focus proxy.

   See also setFocusProxy().

  QWidget * QWidget::focusWidget () const

   Returns the last child of this widget that setFocus had been called
   on. For top level widgets this is the widget that will get focus in
   case this window gets activated

   This is not the same as QApplication::focusWidget(), which returns the
   focus widget in the currently active window.

  QFontInfo QWidget::fontInfo () const

   Returns the font info for the widget's current font. Equivalent to
   QFontInto(widget->font()).

   See also font(), fontMetrics(), and setFont().

  QFontMetrics QWidget::fontMetrics () const

   Returns the font metrics for the widget's current font. Equivalent to
   QFontMetrics(widget->font()).

   See also font(), fontInfo(), and setFont().

  QPalette::ColorRole QWidget::foregroundRole () const

   Returns the foreground role.

   The foreground role defines the color from the widget's palette that
   is used to draw the foreground.

   If no explicit foreground role is set, the function returns a role
   that contrasts with the background role.

   See also setForegroundRole() and backgroundRole().

  void QWidget::getContentsMargins ( int * left, int * top, int * right, int *
  bottom ) const

   Returns the widget's contents margins for left, top, right, and
   bottom.

   See also setContentsMargins() and contentsRect().

  HDC QWidget::getDC () const   [virtual]

   Returns the window system handle of the widget, for low-level access.
   Using this function is not portable.

   An HDC aquired with getDC() has to be released with releaseDC().

   Warning: Using this function is not portable.

   Reimplemented from QPaintDevice.

  void QWidget::grabKeyboard ()

   Grabs the keyboard input.

   This widget reveives all keyboard events until releaseKeyboard() is
   called; other widgets get no keyboard events at all. Mouse events are
   not affected. Use grabMouse() if you want to grab that.

   The focus widget is not affected, except that it doesn't receive any
   keyboard events. setFocus() moves the focus as usual, but the new
   focus widget receives keyboard events only after releaseKeyboard() is
   called.

   If a different widget is currently grabbing keyboard input, that
   widget's grab is released first.

   See also releaseKeyboard(), grabMouse(), releaseMouse(), and
   focusWidget().

  void QWidget::grabMouse ()

   Grabs the mouse input.

   This widget receives all mouse events until releaseMouse() is called;
   other widgets get no mouse events at all. Keyboard events are not
   affected. Use grabKeyboard() if you want to grab that.

   Warning: Bugs in mouse-grabbing applications very often lock the
   terminal. Use this function with extreme caution, and consider using
   the -nograb command line option while debugging.

   It is almost never necessary to grab the mouse when using Qt, as Qt
   grabs and releases it sensibly. In particular, Qt grabs the mouse when
   a mouse button is pressed and keeps it until the last button is
   released.

   Note that only visible widgets can grab mouse input. If isVisible()
   returns false for a widget, that widget cannot call grabMouse().

   focusWidget()

   See also releaseMouse(), grabKeyboard(), releaseKeyboard(), and
   grabKeyboard().

  void QWidget::grabMouse ( const QCursor & cursor )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Grabs the mouse input and changes the cursor shape.

   The cursor will assume shape cursor (for as long as the mouse focus is
   grabbed) and this widget will be the only one to receive mouse events
   until releaseMouse() is called().

   Warning: Grabbing the mouse might lock the terminal.

   See also releaseMouse(), grabKeyboard(), releaseKeyboard(), and
   setCursor().

  int QWidget::grabShortcut ( const QKeySequence & key, Qt::ShortcutContext
  context = Qt::WindowShortcut )

   Adds a shortcut to Qt's shortcut system that watches for the given key
   sequence in the given context. If the context is not OnApplication,
   the shortcut is local to this widget; otherwise it applies to the
   application as a whole.

   If the same key sequence has been grabbed by several widgets, when the
   key sequence occurs a QEvent::Shortcut event is sent to all the
   widgets to which it applies in a non-deterministic order, but with the
   ``ambiguous'' flag set to true.

   Warning: You should not normally need to use this function; instead
   create QActions with the shortcut key sequences you require (if you
   also want equivalent menu options and toolbar buttons), or create
   QShortcuts if you just need key sequences. Both QAction and QShortcut
   handle all the event filtering for you, and provide signals which are
   triggered when the user triggers the key sequence, so are much easier
   to use than this low-level function.

   See also releaseShortcut() and setShortcutEnabled().

  int QWidget::heightForWidth ( int w ) const   [virtual]

   Returns the preferred height for this widget, given the width w.

   If this widget has a layout, the default implementation returns the
   layout's preferred height. if there is no layout, the default
   implementation returns -1 indicating that the preferred height does
   not depend on the width.

  void QWidget::hide ()   [slot]

   Hides the widget. This function is equivalent to setVisible(false).

   See also hideEvent(), isHidden(), show(), setVisible(), isVisible(),
   and close().

  void QWidget::hideEvent ( QHideEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   widget hide events. The event is passed in the event parameter.

   Hide events are sent to widgets immediately after they have been
   hidden.

   Note: A widget receives spontaneous show and hide events when its
   mapping status is changed by the window system, e.g. a spontaneous
   hide event when the user minimizes the window, and a spontaneous show
   event when the window is restored again. After receiving a spontaneous
   hide event, a widget is still considered visible in the sense of
   isVisible().

   See also visible, event(), and QHideEvent.

  QInputContext * QWidget::inputContext ()

   This function returns the QInputContext for this widget. By default
   the input context is inherited from the widgets parent. For toplevels
   it is inherited from QApplication.

   You can override this and set a special input context for this widget
   by using the setInputContext() method.

   See also setInputContext().

  void QWidget::inputMethodEvent ( QInputMethodEvent * e )   [virtual
  protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive Input Method composition events. This handler is called when
   the state of the input method changes.

   The default implementation calls e->ignore(), which rejects the Input
   Method event. See the QInputMethodEvent documentation for more
   details.

   See also event() and QInputMethodEvent.

  QVariant QWidget::inputMethodQuery ( Qt::InputMethodQuery query ) const
  [virtual]

   This method is only relevant for input widgets. It is used by the
   input method to query a set of properties of the widget to be able to
   support complex input method operations as support for surrounding
   text and reconversions.

   query specifies which property is queried.

   See also inputMethodEvent(), QInputMethodEvent, and QInputContext.

  void QWidget::insertAction ( QAction * before, QAction * action )

   Inserts the action action to this widget's list of actions, before the
   action before. It appends the action if before is 0 or before is not a
   valid action for this widget.

   See also addAction().

  void QWidget::insertActions ( QAction * before, QList<QAction *> actions )

   Inserts the actions actions to this widget's list of actions, before
   the action before. It appends the action if before is 0 or before is
   not a valid action for this widget.

   See also removeAction(), QMenu, and insertAction().

  bool QWidget::isAncestorOf ( const QWidget * child ) const

   Returns true if this widget is a parent, (or grandparent and so on to
   any level), of the given child, and both widgets are within the same
   window; otherwise returns false.

  bool QWidget::isEnabledTo ( QWidget * ancestor ) const

   Returns true if this widget would become enabled if ancestor is
   enabled; otherwise returns false.

   This is the case if neither the widget itself nor every parent up to
   but excluding ancestor has been explicitly disabled.

   isEnabledTo(0) is equivalent to isEnabled().

   See also setEnabled() and enabled.

  bool QWidget::isHidden () const

   Returns true if the widget is hidden, otherwise returns false.

   A hidden widget will only become visible when show() is called on it.
   It will not be automatically shown when the parent is shown.

   To check visiblity, use !isVisible() instead (notice the exclamation
   mark).

   isHidden() implies !isVisible(), but a widget can be not visible and
   not hidden at the same time. This is the case for widgets that are
   children of widgets that are not visible.

   Widgets are hidden if they were created as independent windows or as
   children of visible widgets, or if hide() or setVisible(false) was
   called.

  bool QWidget::isVisibleTo ( QWidget * ancestor ) const

   Returns true if this widget would become visible if ancestor is shown;
   otherwise returns false.

   The true case occurs if neither the widget itself nor any parent up to
   but excluding ancestor has been explicitly hidden.

   This function will still return true if the widget is obscured by
   other windows on the screen, but could be physically visible if it or
   they were to be moved.

   isVisibleTo(0) is identical to isVisible().

   See also show(), hide(), and isVisible().

  bool QWidget::isWindow () const

   whether the widget is an independent window

   A window is a widget that isn't visually the child of any other widget
   and that usually has a frame and a window title.

   A window can have a parent widget. It will then be grouped with its
   parent and deleted when the parent is deleted, minimized when the
   parent is minimized etc. If supported by the window manager, it will
   also have a common taskbar entry with its parent.

   QDialog and QMainWindow widgets are by default windows, even if a
   parent widget is specified in the constructor. This behavior is
   specified by the Qt::Window flag.

   See also window(), isModal(), and parentWidget().

  void QWidget::keyPressEvent ( QKeyEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive key press events for the widget.

   A widget must call setFocusPolicy() to accept focus initially and have
   focus in order to receive a key press event.

   If you reimplement this handler, it is very important that you
   ignore() the event if you do not understand it, so that the widget's
   parent can interpret it.

   The default implementation closes popup widgets if the user presses
   Esc. Otherwise the event is ignored.

   See also keyReleaseEvent(), QKeyEvent::ignore(), setFocusPolicy(),
   focusInEvent(), focusOutEvent(), event(), and QKeyEvent.

  void QWidget::keyReleaseEvent ( QKeyEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive key release events for the widget.

   A widget must accept focus initially and have focus in order to
   receive a key release event.

   If you reimplement this handler, it is very important that you
   ignore() the release if you do not understand it, so that the widget's
   parent can interpret it.

   The default implementation ignores the event.

   See also keyPressEvent(), QKeyEvent::ignore(), setFocusPolicy(),
   focusInEvent(), focusOutEvent(), event(), and QKeyEvent.

  QWidget * QWidget::keyboardGrabber ()   [static]

   Returns the widget that is currently grabbing the keyboard input.

   If no widget in this application is currently grabbing the keyboard, 0
   is returned.

   See also grabMouse() and mouseGrabber().

  QLayout * QWidget::layout () const

   Returns the layout engine that manages the geometry of this widget's
   children.

   If the widget does not have a layout, layout() returns 0.

   See also setLayout() and sizePolicy().

  void QWidget::leaveEvent ( QEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   widget leave events which are passed in the event parameter.

   A leave event is sent to the widget when the mouse cursor leaves the
   widget.

   See also enterEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(), and event().

  void QWidget::lower ()   [slot]

   Lowers the widget to the bottom of the parent widget's stack.

   After this call the widget will be visually behind (and therefore
   obscured by) any overlapping sibling widgets.

   See also raise() and stackUnder().

  bool QWidget::macEvent ( EventHandlerCallRef caller, EventRef event )
  [virtual protected]

   This special event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive native Macintosh events which are passed from the caller with
   the event details in the event parameter.

   In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to stop the
   event being handled by Qt, return true. If you return false, this
   native event is passed back to Qt, which translates the event into a
   Qt event and sends it to the widget.

   Warning: This function is not portable.

   See also QApplication::macEventFilter().

  QPoint QWidget::mapFrom ( QWidget * parent, const QPoint & pos ) const

   Translates the widget coordinate pos from the coordinate system of
   parent to this widget's coordinate system. The parent must not be 0
   and must be a parent of the calling widget.

   See also mapTo(), mapFromParent(), mapFromGlobal(), and underMouse().

  QPoint QWidget::mapFromGlobal ( const QPoint & pos ) const

   Translates the global screen coordinate pos to widget coordinates.

   See also mapToGlobal(), mapFrom(), and mapFromParent().

  QPoint QWidget::mapFromParent ( const QPoint & pos ) const

   Translates the parent widget coordinate pos to widget coordinates.

   Same as mapFromGlobal() if the widget has no parent.

   See also mapToParent(), mapFrom(), mapFromGlobal(), and underMouse().

  QPoint QWidget::mapTo ( QWidget * parent, const QPoint & pos ) const

   Translates the widget coordinate pos to the coordinate system of
   parent. The parent must not be 0 and must be a parent of the calling
   widget.

   See also mapFrom(), mapToParent(), mapToGlobal(), and underMouse().

  QPoint QWidget::mapToGlobal ( const QPoint & pos ) const

   Translates the widget coordinate pos to global screen coordinates. For
   example, mapToGlobal(QPoint(0,0)) would give the global coordinates of
   the top-left pixel of the widget.

   See also mapFromGlobal(), mapTo(), and mapToParent().

  QPoint QWidget::mapToParent ( const QPoint & pos ) const

   Translates the widget coordinate pos to a coordinate in the parent
   widget.

   Same as mapToGlobal() if the widget has no parent.

   See also mapFromParent(), mapTo(), mapToGlobal(), and underMouse().

  QRegion QWidget::mask () const

   Returns the mask currently set on a widget. If no mask is set the
   return value will be an empty region.

   See also setMask(), clearMask(), and QRegion::isEmpty().

  int QWidget::metric ( PaintDeviceMetric m ) const   [virtual protected]

   Internal implementation of the virtual QPaintDevice::metric()
   function.

   m is the metric to get.

   Reimplemented from QPaintDevice.

  void QWidget::mouseDoubleClickEvent ( QMouseEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive mouse double click events for the widget.

   The default implementation generates a normal mouse press event.

   Note that the widgets gets a mousePressEvent() and a
   mouseReleaseEvent() before the mouseDoubleClickEvent().

   See also mousePressEvent(), mouseReleaseEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(),
   event(), and QMouseEvent.

  QWidget * QWidget::mouseGrabber ()   [static]

   Returns the widget that is currently grabbing the mouse input.

   If no widget in this application is currently grabbing the mouse, 0 is
   returned.

   See also grabMouse() and keyboardGrabber().

  void QWidget::mouseMoveEvent ( QMouseEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive mouse move events for the widget.

   If mouse tracking is switched off, mouse move events only occur if a
   mouse button is pressed while the mouse is being moved. If mouse
   tracking is switched on, mouse move events occur even if no mouse
   button is pressed.

   QMouseEvent::pos() reports the position of the mouse cursor, relative
   to this widget. For press and release events, the position is usually
   the same as the position of the last mouse move event, but it might be
   different if the user's hand shakes. This is a feature of the
   underlying window system, not Qt.

   See also setMouseTracking(), mousePressEvent(), mouseReleaseEvent(),
   mouseDoubleClickEvent(), event(), and QMouseEvent.

  void QWidget::mousePressEvent ( QMouseEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive mouse press events for the widget.

   If you create new widgets in the mousePressEvent() the
   mouseReleaseEvent() may not end up where you expect, depending on the
   underlying window system (or X11 window manager), the widgets'
   location and maybe more.

   The default implementation implements the closing of popup widgets
   when you click outside the window. For other widget types it does
   nothing.

   See also mouseReleaseEvent(), mouseDoubleClickEvent(),
   mouseMoveEvent(), event(), and QMouseEvent.

  void QWidget::mouseReleaseEvent ( QMouseEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive mouse release events for the widget.

   See also mousePressEvent(), mouseDoubleClickEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(),
   event(), and QMouseEvent.

  void QWidget::moveEvent ( QMoveEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   widget move events which are passed in the event parameter. When the
   widget receives this event, it is already at the new position.

   The old position is accessible through QMoveEvent::oldPos().

   See also resizeEvent(), event(), move(), and QMoveEvent.

  QWidget * QWidget::nextInFocusChain () const

   Returns the next widget in this widget's focus chain.

  void QWidget::overrideWindowFlags ( Qt::WindowFlags flags )

   Sets the window flags for the widget to flags, without telling the
   window system.

   Warning: Do not call this function unless you really know what you're
   doing.

   See also setWindowFlags().

  QPaintEngine * QWidget::paintEngine () const   [virtual]

   Returns the widget's paint engine.

   Reimplemented from QPaintDevice.

  void QWidget::paintEvent ( QPaintEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive paint
   events which are passed in the event parameter.

   A paint event is a request to repaint all or part of the widget. It
   can happen as a result of repaint() or update(), or because the widget
   was obscured and has now been uncovered, or for many other reasons.

   Many widgets can simply repaint their entire surface when asked to,
   but some slow widgets need to optimize by painting only the requested
   region: QPaintEvent::region(). This speed optimization does not change
   the result, as painting is clipped to that region during event
   processing. QListView and QTableView do this, for example.

   Qt also tries to speed up painting by merging multiple paint events
   into one. When update() is called several times or the window system
   sends several paint events, Qt merges these events into one event with
   a larger region (see QRegion::unite()). repaint() does not permit this
   optimization, so we suggest using update() when possible.

   When the paint event occurs, the update region has normally been
   erased, so that you're painting on the widget's background.

   The background can be set using setBackgroundRole() and setPalette().

   From Qt 4.0, QWidget automatically double-buffers its painting, so
   there's no need to write double-buffering code in paintEvent() to
   avoid flicker.

   Note: Under X11 it is possible to toggle the global double buffering
   by calling qt_x11_set_global_double_buffer(). Example usage:
    ...
    extern void qt_x11_set_global_double_buffer(bool);
    qt_x11_set_global_double_buffer(false);
    ...

   See also event(), repaint(), update(), QPainter, QPixmap, and
   QPaintEvent.

  QWidget * QWidget::parentWidget () const

   Returns the parent of this widget, or 0 if it does not have any parent
   widget.

  bool QWidget::qwsEvent ( QWSEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This special event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive native Qt/Embedded events which are passed in the event
   parameter.

   In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to stop the
   event being handled by Qt, return true. If you return false, this
   native event is passed back to Qt, which translates the event into a
   Qt event and sends it to the widget.

   Warning: This function is not portable.

   See also QApplication::qwsEventFilter().

  void QWidget::raise ()   [slot]

   Raises this widget to the top of the parent widget's stack.

   After this call the widget will be visually in front of any
   overlapping sibling widgets.

   See also lower() and stackUnder().

  void QWidget::releaseDC ( HDC hdc ) const   [virtual]

   Releases the HDC hdc aquired by a previous call to getDC().

   Warning: Using this function is not portable.

   Reimplemented from QPaintDevice.

  void QWidget::releaseKeyboard ()

   Releases the keyboard grab.

   See also grabKeyboard(), grabMouse(), and releaseMouse().

  void QWidget::releaseMouse ()

   Releases the mouse grab.

   See also grabMouse(), grabKeyboard(), and releaseKeyboard().

  void QWidget::releaseShortcut ( int id )

   Removes the shortcut with the given id from Qt's shortcut system. The
   widget will no longer receive QEvent::Shortcut events for the
   shortcut's key sequence (unless it has other shortcuts with the same
   key sequence).

   Warning: You should not normally need to use this function since Qt's
   shortcut system removes shortcuts automatically when their parent
   widget is destroyed. It is best to use QAction or QShortcut to handle
   shortcuts, since they are easier to use than this low-level function.
   Note also that this is an expensive operation.

   See also grabShortcut() and setShortcutEnabled().

  void QWidget::removeAction ( QAction * action )

   Removes the action action from this widget's list of actions.

  void QWidget::repaint ()   [slot]

   Repaints the widget directly by calling paintEvent() immediately,
   unless updates are disabled or the widget is hidden.

   We suggest only using repaint() if you need an immediate repaint, for
   example during animation. In almost all circumstances update() is
   better, as it permits Qt to optimize for speed and minimize flicker.

   Warning: If you call repaint() in a function which may itself be
   called from paintEvent(), you may get infinite recursion. The update()
   function never causes recursion.

   See also update(), paintEvent(), and setUpdatesEnabled().

  void QWidget::repaint ( int x, int y, int w, int h )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version repaints a rectangle (x, y, w, h) inside the widget.

   If w is negative, it is replaced with width() - x, and if h is
   negative, it is replaced width height() - y.

  void QWidget::repaint ( const QRect & r )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version repaints a rectangle r inside the widget.

  void QWidget::repaint ( const QRegion & rgn )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version repaints a region rgn inside the widget.

  void QWidget::resetInputContext ()   [protected]

   This function is called when text widgets need to be neutral state to
   execute text operations properly. See qlineedit.cpp and qtextedit.cpp
   as example.

   Ordinary reset that along with changing focus to another widget,
   moving the cursor, etc, is implicitly handled via
   unfocusInputContext() because whether reset or not when such situation
   is a responsibility of input methods. So we delegate the
   responsibility to the input context via unfocusInputContext(). See
   'Preedit preservation' section of the class description of
   QInputContext for further information.

   See also QInputContext and QInputContext::reset().

  void QWidget::resizeEvent ( QResizeEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   widget resize events which are passed in the event parameter. When
   resizeEvent() is called, the widget already has its new geometry. The
   old size is accessible through QResizeEvent::oldSize().

   The widget will be erased and receive a paint event immediately after
   processing the resize event. No drawing need be (or should be) done
   inside this handler.

   See also moveEvent(), event(), resize(), QResizeEvent, and
   paintEvent().

  void QWidget::scroll ( int dx, int dy )

   Scrolls the widget including its children dx pixels to the right and
   dy downwards. Both dx and dy may be negative.

   After scrolling, scroll() sends a paint event for the the part that is
   read but not written. For example, when scrolling 10 pixels
   rightwards, the leftmost ten pixels of the widget need repainting. The
   paint event may be delivered immediately or later, depending on some
   heuristics (note that you might have to force processing of paint
   events using QApplication::sendPostedEvents() when using scroll() and
   move() in combination).

   See also QScrollView and bitBlt().

  void QWidget::scroll ( int dx, int dy, const QRect & r )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version only scrolls r and does not move the children of the
   widget.

   If r is empty or invalid, the result is undefined.

   See also QScrollView and bitBlt().

  void QWidget::setAttribute ( Qt::WidgetAttribute attribute, bool on = true )

   Sets the attribute attribute on this widget if on is true; otherwise
   clears the attribute.

   See also testAttribute().

  void QWidget::setBackgroundRole ( QPalette::ColorRole role )

   Sets the background role of the widget to role.

   The background role defines the brush from the widget's palette that
   is used to render the background.

   If role is QPalette::NoRole, then the widget inherits its parent's
   background role.

   See also backgroundRole() and foregroundRole().

  void QWidget::setContentsMargins ( int left, int top, int right, int bottom )

   Sets the margins around the contents of the widget to have the sizes
   left, top, right, and bottom. The margins are used by the layout
   system, and may be used by subclasses to specify the area to draw in
   (e.g. excluding the frame).

   Changing the margins will trigger a resizeEvent().

   See also contentsRect() and getContentsMargins().

  void QWidget::setDisabled ( bool disable )   [slot]

   Disables widget input events if disable is true; otherwise enables
   input events.

   See the enabled documentation for more information.

   See also isEnabledTo(), QKeyEvent, QMouseEvent, and changeEvent().

  void QWidget::setFixedHeight ( int h )

   Sets both the minimum and maximum heights of the widget to h without
   changing the widths. Provided for convenience.

   See also sizeHint(), minimumSize(), maximumSize(), and setFixedSize().

  void QWidget::setFixedSize ( const QSize & s )

   Sets both the minimum and maximum sizes of the widget to s, thereby
   preventing it from ever growing or shrinking.

   This will override the default size constraints set by QLayout.

   Alternatively, if you want the widget to have a fixed size based on
   its contents, you can call
   QLayout::setSizeConstraint(QLayout::SetFixedSize);

   See also maximumSize and minimumSize.

  void QWidget::setFixedSize ( int w, int h )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the width of the widget to w and the height to h.

  void QWidget::setFixedWidth ( int w )

   Sets both the minimum and maximum width of the widget to w without
   changing the heights. Provided for convenience.

   See also sizeHint(), minimumSize(), maximumSize(), and setFixedSize().

  void QWidget::setFocus ( Qt::FocusReason reason )

   Gives the keyboard input focus to this widget (or its focus proxy) if
   this widget or one of its parents is the active window. The reason
   argument will be passed into any focus event sent from this function,
   it is used to give an explanation of what caused the widget to get
   focus.

   First, a focus out event is sent to the focus widget (if any) to tell
   it that it is about to lose the focus. Then a focus in event is sent
   to this widget to tell it that it just received the focus. (Nothing
   happens if the focus in and focus out widgets are the same.)

   setFocus() gives focus to a widget regardless of its focus policy, but
   does not clear any keyboard grab (see grabKeyboard()).

   Be aware that if the widget is hidden, it will not accept focus.

   Warning: If you call setFocus() in a function which may itself be
   called from focusOutEvent() or focusInEvent(), you may get an infinite
   recursion.

   setFocusPolicy() QApplication::focusWidget() grabKeyboard()
   grabMouse(), {Keyboard Focus}

   See also hasFocus(), clearFocus(), focusInEvent(), and
   focusOutEvent().

  void QWidget::setFocus ()   [slot]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Gives the keyboard input focus to this widget (or its focus proxy) if
   this widget or one of its parents is the active window.

  void QWidget::setFocusProxy ( QWidget * w )

   Sets the widget's focus proxy to widget w. If w is 0, the function
   resets this widget to have no focus proxy.

   Some widgets can "have focus", but create a child widget, such as
   QLineEdit, to actually handle the focus. In this case, the widget can
   set the line edit to be its focus proxy.

   setFocusProxy() sets the widget which will actually get focus when
   "this widget" gets it. If there is a focus proxy, setFocus() and
   hasFocus() operate on the focus proxy.

   See also focusProxy().

  void QWidget::setForegroundRole ( QPalette::ColorRole role )

   Sets the foreground role of the widget to role.

   The foreground role defines the color from the widget's palette that
   is used to draw the foreground.

   If role is QPalette::NoRole, the widget uses a foreground role that
   contrasts with the background role.

   See also foregroundRole() and backgroundRole().

  void QWidget::setHidden ( bool hidden )   [slot]

   Convenience function, equivalent to setVisible(!hidden).

  void QWidget::setInputContext ( QInputContext * context )

   This function sets the input context context on this widget.

   See also inputContext().

  void QWidget::setLayout ( QLayout * l )

   Sets the layout engine for this widget to l.

   There can be only one top-level layout for a widget.

   See also layout().

  void QWidget::setMask ( const QBitmap & bitmap )

   Causes only the pixels of the widget for which bitmap has a
   corresponding 1 bit to be visible. If the region includes pixels
   outside the rect() of the widget, window system controls in that area
   may or may not be visible, depending on the platform.

   Note that this effect can be slow if the region is particularly
   complex.

   The following code shows how an image with an alpha channel can be
   used to generate a mask for a widget:
        QLabel topLevelLabel;
        QPixmap pixmap(":/images/tux.png");
        topLevelLabel.setPixmap(pixmap);
        topLevelLabel.setMask(pixmap.mask());

   The label shown by this code is masked using the image it contains,
   giving the appearance that an irregularly-shaped image is being drawn
   directly onto the screen.

   See also clearMask().

  void QWidget::setMask ( const QRegion & region )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Causes only the parts of the widget which overlap region to be
   visible. If the region includes pixels outside the rect() of the
   widget, window system controls in that area may or may not be visible,
   depending on the platform.

   Note that this effect can be slow if the region is particularly
   complex.

   See also setMask() and clearMask().

  void QWidget::setParent ( QWidget * parent )

   Sets the parent of the widget to parent. The widget is moved to
   position (0, 0) in its new parent.

   If the new parent widget is in a different window, the reparented
   widget and its children are appended to the end of the tab chain of
   the new parent widget, in the same internal order as before. If one of
   the moved widgets had keyboard focus, setParent() calls clearFocus()
   for that widget.

   If the new parent widget is in the same window as the old parent,
   setting the parent doesn't change the tab order or keyboard focus.

   If the "new" parent widget is the old parent widget, this function
   does nothing.

   Warning: It is very unlikely that you will ever need this function. If
   you have a widget that changes its content dynamically, it is far
   easier to use QStackedWidget.

   See also setWindowFlags().

  void QWidget::setParent ( QWidget * parent, Qt::WFlags f )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This function also takes widget flags, f as an argument.

  void QWidget::setShortcutEnabled ( int id, bool enable = true )

   If enable is true, the shortcut with the given id is enabled;
   otherwise the shortcut is disabled.

   Warning: You should not normally need to use this function since Qt's
   shortcut system enables/disables shortcuts automatically as widgets
   become hidden/visible and gain or lose focus. It is best to use
   QAction or QShortcut to handle shortcuts, since they are easier to use
   than this low-level function.

   See also grabShortcut() and releaseShortcut().

  void QWidget::setStyle ( QStyle * style )

   Sets the widget's GUI style to style. Ownership of the style object is
   not transferred.

   If no style is set, the widget uses the application's style,
   QApplication::style() instead.

   Setting a widget's style has no effect on existing or future child
   widgets.

   Warning: This function is particularly useful for demonstration
   purposes, where you want to show Qt's styling capabilities. Real
   applications should avoid it and use one consistent GUI style instead.

   See also style(), QStyle, QApplication::style(), and
   QApplication::setStyle().

  void QWidget::setTabOrder ( QWidget * first, QWidget * second )   [static]

   Moves the second widget around the ring of focus widgets so that
   keyboard focus moves from the first widget to the second widget when
   the Tab key is pressed.

   Note that since the tab order of the second widget is changed, you
   should order a chain like this:
    setTabOrder(a, b); // a to b
    setTabOrder(b, c); // a to b to c
    setTabOrder(c, d); // a to b to c to d

   not like this:
    setTabOrder(c, d); // c to d   WRONG
    setTabOrder(a, b); // a to b AND c to d
    setTabOrder(b, c); // a to b to c, but not c to d

   If first or second has a focus proxy, setTabOrder() correctly
   substitutes the proxy.

   See also setFocusPolicy(), setFocusProxy(), and Keyboard Focus.

  void QWidget::setWindowRole ( const QString & role )

   Sets the window's role to role. This only makes sense for windows on
   X11.

  void QWidget::setWindowState ( Qt::WindowStates windowState )

   Sets the window state to windowState. The window state is a OR'ed
   combination of Qt::WindowState: Qt::WindowMinimized,
   Qt::WindowMaximized, Qt::WindowFullScreen and Qt::WindowActive.

   If the window is not visible (i.e. isVisible() returns false), the
   window state will take effect when show() is called. For visible
   windows, the change is immediate. For example, to toggle between
   full-screen and mormal mode, use the following code:
    w->setWindowState(w->windowState() ^ Qt::WindowFullScreen);

   In order to restore and activate a minimized window (while preserving
   its maximized and/or full-screen state), use the following:
    w->setWindowState(w->windowState() & ~Qt::WindowMinimized | Qt::WindowActiv
e);

   Note: On some window systems Qt::WindowActive is not immediate, and
   may be ignored in certain cases.

   See also Qt::WindowState and windowState().

  void QWidget::show ()   [slot]

   Shows the widget and its child widgets. This function is equivalent to
   setVisible(true).

   See also showEvent(), hide(), setVisible(), showMinimized(),
   showMaximized(), showNormal(), and isVisible().

  void QWidget::showEvent ( QShowEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   widget show events which are passed in the event parameter.

   Non-spontaneous show events are sent to widgets immediately before
   they are shown. The spontaneous show events of windows are delivered
   afterwards.

   Note: A widget receives spontaneous show and hide events when its
   mapping status is changed by the window system, e.g. a spontaneous
   hide event when the user minimizes the window, and a spontaneous show
   event when the window is restored again. After receiving a spontaneous
   hide event, a widget is still considered visible in the sense of
   isVisible().

   See also visible, event(), and QShowEvent.

  void QWidget::showFullScreen ()   [slot]

   Shows the widget in full-screen mode.

   Calling this function only affects windows.

   To return from full-screen mode, call showNormal().

   Full-screen mode works fine under Windows, but has certain problems
   under X. These problems are due to limitations of the ICCCM protocol
   that specifies the communication between X11 clients and the window
   manager. ICCCM simply does not understand the concept of non-decorated
   full-screen windows. Therefore, the best we can do is to request a
   borderless window and place and resize it to fill the entire screen.
   Depending on the window manager, this may or may not work. The
   borderless window is requested using MOTIF hints, which are at least
   partially supported by virtually all modern window managers.

   An alternative would be to bypass the window manager entirely and
   create a window with the Qt::WX11BypassWM flag. This has other severe
   problems though, like totally broken keyboard focus and very strange
   effects on desktop changes or when the user raises other windows.

   X11 window managers that follow modern post-ICCCM specifications
   support full-screen mode properly.

   See also showNormal(), showMaximized(), show(), hide(), and
   isVisible().

  void QWidget::showMaximized ()   [slot]

   Shows the widget maximized.

   Calling this function only affects windows.

   On X11, this function may not work properly with certain window
   managers. See Window Geometry for an explanation.

   See also setWindowState(), showNormal(), showMinimized(), show(),
   hide(), and isVisible().

  void QWidget::showMinimized ()   [slot]

   Shows the widget minimized, as an icon.

   Calling this function only affects windows.

   See also showNormal(), showMaximized(), show(), hide(), isVisible(),
   and isMinimized().

  void QWidget::showNormal ()   [slot]

   Restores the widget after it has been maximized or minimized.

   Calling this function only affects windows.

   See also setWindowState(), showMinimized(), showMaximized(), show(),
   hide(), and isVisible().

  void QWidget::stackUnder ( QWidget * w )

   Places the widget under w in the parent widget's stack.

   To make this work, the widget itself and w must be siblings.

   See also raise() and lower().

  QStyle * QWidget::style () const

   Returns the GUI style for this widget

   See also QWidget::setStyle(), QApplication::setStyle(), and
   QApplication::style().

  void QWidget::tabletEvent ( QTabletEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive tablet events for the widget.

   If you reimplement this handler, it is very important that you
   ignore() the event if you do not handle it, so that the widget's
   parent can interpret it.

   The default implementation ignores the event.

   See also QTabletEvent::ignore(), QTabletEvent::accept(), event(), and
   QTabletEvent.

  bool QWidget::testAttribute ( Qt::WidgetAttribute attribute ) const

   Returns true if attribute attribute is set on this widget; otherwise
   returns false.

   See also setAttribute().

  bool QWidget::underMouse () const

   Returns true if the widget is under the mouse cursor; otherwise
   returns false.

   This value is not updated properly during drag and drop operations.

   See also enterEvent() and leaveEvent().

  void QWidget::update ()   [slot]

   Updates the widget unless updates are disabled or the widget is
   hidden.

   This function does not cause an immediate repaint; instead it
   schedules a paint event for processing when Qt returns to the main
   event loop. This permits Qt to optimize for more speed and less
   flicker than a call to repaint() does.

   Calling update() several times normally results in just one
   paintEvent() call.

   Qt normally erases the widget's area before the paintEvent() call. If
   the Qt::WRepaintNoErase widget flag is set, the widget is responsible
   for painting all its pixels itself.

   See also repaint(), paintEvent(), and setUpdatesEnabled().

  void QWidget::update ( int x, int y, int w, int h )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version updates a rectangle (x, y, w, h) inside the widget.

  void QWidget::update ( const QRect & r )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version updates a rectangle r inside the widget.

  void QWidget::update ( const QRegion & rgn )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version repaints a region rgn inside the widget.

  void QWidget::updateGeometry ()

   Notifies the layout system that this widget has changed and may need
   to change geometry.

   Call this function if the sizeHint() or sizePolicy() have changed.

   For explicitly hidden widgets, updateGeometry() is a no-op. The layout
   system will be notified as soon as the widget is shown.

  void QWidget::updateMicroFocus ()   [protected]

   Updates the widget's micro focus.

   See also QInputContext.

  QRegion QWidget::visibleRegion () const

   Returns the unobscured region where paint events can occur.

   For visible widgets, this is an approximation of the area not covered
   by other widgets; otherwise, this is an empty region.

   The repaint() function calls this function if necessary, so in general
   you do not need to call it.

  void QWidget::wheelEvent ( QWheelEvent * e )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler, for event e, can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive wheel events for the widget.

   If you reimplement this handler, it is very important that you
   ignore() the event if you do not handle it, so that the widget's
   parent can interpret it.

   The default implementation ignores the event.

   See also QWheelEvent::ignore(), QWheelEvent::accept(), event(), and
   QWheelEvent.

  bool QWidget::winEvent ( MSG * message, long * result )   [virtual protected]

   This special event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive native Windows events which are passed in the message
   parameter.

   In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to stop the
   event being handled by Qt, return true and set result to the value
   that the window procedure should return. If you return false, this
   native event is passed back to Qt, which translates the event into a
   Qt event and sends it to the widget.

   Warning: This function is not portable.

   See also QApplication::winEventFilter().

  WId QWidget::winId () const

   Returns the window system identifier of the widget.

   Portable in principle, but if you use it you are probably about to do
   something non-portable. Be careful.

   See also find().

  QWidget * QWidget::window () const

   Returns the window for this widget, i.e. the next ancestor widget that
   has (or could have) a window-system frame.

   If the widget is a window, the widget itself is returned.

   Typical usage is changing the window title:
    aWidget->window()->setWindowTitle("New Window Title");

   See also isWindow().

  QString QWidget::windowRole () const

   Returns the window's role, or an empty string.

   See also windowIcon and windowTitle.

  Qt::WindowStates QWidget::windowState () const

   Returns the current window state. The window state is a OR'ed
   combination of Qt::WindowState: Qt::WindowMinimized,
   Qt::WindowMaximized, Qt::WindowFullScreen and Qt::WindowActive.

   See also Qt::WindowState and setWindowState().

  Qt::WindowType QWidget::windowType () const

   Returns the window type of this widget. This is identical to
   windowFlags() & Qt::WindowType_Mask.

   See also windowFlags.

  bool QWidget::x11Event ( XEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This special event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to
   receive native X11 events which are passed in the event parameter.

   In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to stop the
   event being handled by Qt, return true. If you return false, this
   native event is passed back to Qt, which translates the event into a
   Qt event and sends it to the widget.

   Warning: This function is not portable.

   See also QApplication::x11EventFilter().

  Qt::HANDLE QWidget::x11PictureHandle () const

   Returns the X11 Picture handle of the widget for XRender support. Use
   of this function is not portable. This function will return 0 if
   XRender support is not compiled into Qt, if the XRender extension is
   not supported on the X11 display, or if the handle could not be
   created.
