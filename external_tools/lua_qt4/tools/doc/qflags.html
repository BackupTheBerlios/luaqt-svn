Detailed Description

   The QFlags class provides a type-safe way of storing OR-combinations
   of enum values.

   The QFlags<Enum> class is a template class, where Enum is an enum
   type. QFlags is used throughout Qt for storing combinations of enum
   values.

   The traditional C++ approach for storing OR-combinations of enum
   values is to use a int or uint variable. The inconvenient with that
   approach is that there's no type checking at all; any enum value can
   be OR'd with any other enum value and passed on to a function that
   takes a int or uint.

   Qt uses QFlags to provide type safety. For example, the Qt::Alignment
   type is simply a typedef for QFlags<Qt::AlignmentFlag>.
   QLabel::setAlignment() takes a Qt::Alignment parameter, which means
   that any combination of Qt::AlignmentFlag values is legal:
    label->setAlignment(Qt::AlignLeft | Qt::AlignTop);

   If you try to pass a value from another enum, the compiler will report
   an error.

   If you want to use QFlags for your own enum types, you must use the
   Q_DECLARE_FLAGS() and Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS(). For example:
    class MyClass
    {
    public:
        enum Option {
            NoOptions = 0x0,
            ShowTabs = 0x1,
            ShowAll = 0x2,
            SqueezeBlank = 0x4
        };
        Q_DECLARE_FLAGS(Options, Option)
        ...
    };

    Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS(MyClass::Options)

   You can then use the MyClass::Options type to store combinations of
   MyClass::Option values.

   A sensible naming convension for enum types and associated QFlags
   types is to give a singular name to the enum type (e.g., Option) and a
   plural name to the QFlags type (e.g., Options). When a singular name
   is desired for the QFlags type (e.g., Alignment), you can use Flag as
   the suffix for the enum type (e.g., AlignmentFlag).

Member Function Documentation

  QFlags::QFlags ( const QFlags & other )

   Constructs a copy of other.

  QFlags::QFlags ( Enum flag )

   Constructs a QFlags object storing the given flag.

  QFlags::QFlags ( Zero zero = 0 )

   Constructs a QFlags object with no flags set. zero must be a literal 0
   value.

  QFlags::QFlags ( QFlag value )

   Constructs a QFlags object initialized with the given integer value.

   The QFlag type is a helper type. By using it here instead of int, we
   effectively ensure that arbitrary enum values cannot be cast to a
   QFlags, whereas untyped enum values (i.e., int values) can.

  QFlags::operator int () const

   Returns the value stored in the QFlags object as an integer.

  bool QFlags::operator! () const

   Returns true if no flag is set (i.e., if the value stored by the
   QFlags object is 0); otherwise returns false.

  QFlags QFlags::operator& ( int mask ) const

   Returns a QFlags object containing the result of the bitwise AND
   operation on this object and mask.

   See also operator&=(), operator|(), operator^(), and operator~().

  QFlags QFlags::operator& ( uint mask ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QFlags QFlags::operator& ( Enum mask ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QFlags & QFlags::operator&= ( int mask )

   Performs a bitwise AND operation with mask and stores the result in
   this QFlags object. Returns a reference to this object.

   See also operator&(), operator|=(), and operator^=().

  QFlags & QFlags::operator&= ( uint mask )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QFlags & QFlags::operator= ( const QFlags & other )

   Assigns other to this object and returns a reference to this object.

  QFlags QFlags::operator^ ( QFlags other ) const

   Returns a QFlags object containing the result of the bitwise XOR
   operation on this object and other.

   See also operator^=(), operator&(), operator|(), and operator~().

  QFlags QFlags::operator^ ( Enum other ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QFlags & QFlags::operator^= ( QFlags other )

   Performs a bitwise XOR operation with other and stores the result in
   this QFlags object. Returns a reference to this object.

   See also operator^(), operator&=(), and operator|=().

  QFlags & QFlags::operator^= ( Enum other )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QFlags QFlags::operator| ( QFlags other ) const

   Returns a QFlags object containing the result of the bitwise OR
   operation on this object and other.

   See also operator|=(), operator^(), operator&(), and operator~().

  QFlags QFlags::operator| ( Enum other ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QFlags & QFlags::operator|= ( QFlags other )

   Performs a bitwise OR operation with other and stores the result in
   this QFlags object. Returns a reference to this object.

   See also operator|(), operator&=(), and operator^=().

  QFlags & QFlags::operator|= ( Enum other )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QFlags QFlags::operator~ () const

   Returns a QFlags object that contains the bitwise negation of this
   objec;t.

   See also operator&(), operator|(), and operator^().

Macro Documentation

  Q_DECLARE_FLAGS ( Flags, Enum )

   The Q_DECLARE_FLAGS() macro expands to
    typedef QFlags<Enum> Flags;

   Enum is the name of an existing enum type, whereas Flags is the name
   of the QFlags<Enum> typedef.

   See the QFlags documentation for details.

   See also Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS().

  Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS ( Flags )

   The Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS() macro declares global operator|()
   functions for Flags, which is of type QFlags<T>.

   See the QFlags documentation for details.

   See also Q_DECLARE_FLAGS().
