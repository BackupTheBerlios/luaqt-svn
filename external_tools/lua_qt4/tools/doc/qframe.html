Detailed Description

   The QFrame class is the base class of widgets that can have a frame.

   QMenu uses this to "raise" the menu above the surrounding screen.
   QProgressBar has a "sunken" look. QLabel has a flat look. The frames
   of widgets like these can be changed.
    QLabel label(...);
    label.setFrameStyle(QFrame::Panel | QFrame::Raised);
    label.setLineWidth(2);

    QProgressBar pbar(...);
    label.setFrameStyle(QFrame::NoFrame);

   The QFrame class can also be used directly for creating simple frames
   without any contents, although usually you would use a QHBox or QVBox
   because they automatically lay out the widgets you put inside the
   frame.

   A frame widget has four attributes: frameStyle(), lineWidth(),
   midLineWidth(), and margin().

   The frame style is specified by a frame shape and a shadow style. The
   frame shapes are NoFrame, Box, Panel, StyledPanel, HLine and VLine;
   the shadow styles are Plain, Raised and Sunken.

   The line width is the width of the frame border.

   The mid-line width specifies the width of an extra line in the middle
   of the frame, which uses a third color to obtain a special 3D effect.
   Notice that a mid-line is only drawn for Box, HLine and VLine frames
   that are raised or sunken.

   The margin is the gap between the frame and the contents of the frame.

   This table shows the most useful combinations of styles and widths
   (and some rather useless ones):

Member Type Documentation

  enum QFrame::Shadow

   This enum type defines the 3D effect used for QFrame's frame.

   Constant Value Description
   QFrame::Plain 0x0010 the frame and contents appear level with the
   surroundings; draws using the palette foreground color (without any 3D
   effect)
   QFrame::Raised 0x0020 the frame and contents appear raised; draws a 3D
   raised line using the light and dark colors of the current color group
   QFrame::Sunken 0x0030 the frame and contents appear sunken; draws a 3D
   sunken line using the light and dark colors of the current color group

   Shadow interacts with QFrame::Shape, the lineWidth() and the
   midLineWidth(). See the picture of the frames in the main class
   documentation.

   See also QFrame::Shape, lineWidth(), and midLineWidth().

  enum QFrame::Shape

   This enum type defines the shapes of a QFrame's frame.

   Constant Value Description
   QFrame::NoFrame 0 QFrame draws nothing
   QFrame::Box 0x0001 QFrame draws a box around its contents
   QFrame::Panel 0x0002 QFrame draws a panel to make the contents appear
   raised or sunken
   QFrame::StyledPanel 0x0006 draws a rectangular panel with a look that
   depends on the current GUI style. It can be raised or sunken.
   QFrame::HLine 0x0004 QFrame draws a horizontal line that frames
   nothing (useful as separator)
   QFrame::VLine 0x0005 QFrame draws a vertical line that frames nothing
   (useful as separator)
   QFrame::WinPanel 0x0003 draws a rectangular panel that can be raised
   or sunken like those in Windows 95. Specifying this shape sets the
   line width to 2 pixels. WinPanel is provided for compatibility. For
   GUI style independence we recommend using StyledPanel instead.

   When it does not call QStyle, Shape interacts with QFrame::Shadow, the
   lineWidth() and the midLineWidth() to create the total result. See the
   picture of the frames in the main class documentation.

   See also QFrame::Shadow, QFrame::style(), and QStyle::drawPrimitive().

Property Documentation

  frameRect : QRect

   This property holds the frame's rectangle.

   The frame's rectangle is the rectangle the frame is drawn in. By
   default, this is the entire widget. Setting the rectangle does does
   not cause a widget update. The frame rectangle is automatically
   adjusted when the widget changes size.

   If you set the rectangle to a null rectangle (for example QRect(0, 0,
   0, 0)), then the resulting frame rectangle is equivalent to the widget
   rectangle.

   Access functions:
     * QRect frameRect () const
     * void setFrameRect ( const QRect & )

  frameShadow : Shadow

   This property holds the frame shadow value from the frame style.

   Access functions:
     * Shadow frameShadow () const
     * void setFrameShadow ( Shadow )

   See also frameStyle() and frameShape().

  frameShape : Shape

   This property holds the frame shape value from the frame style.

   Access functions:
     * Shape frameShape () const
     * void setFrameShape ( Shape )

   See also frameStyle() and frameShadow().

  frameWidth : const int

   This property holds the width of the frame that is drawn.

   Note that the frame width depends on the frame style, not only the
   line width and the mid-line width. For example, the style NoFrame
   always has a frame width of 0, whereas the style Panel has a frame
   width equivalent to the line width.

   Access functions:
     * int frameWidth () const

   See also lineWidth(), midLineWidth(), and frameStyle().

  lineWidth : int

   This property holds the line width.

   Note that the total line width for HLine and VLine is specified by
   frameWidth(), not lineWidth().

   The default value is 1.

   Access functions:
     * int lineWidth () const
     * void setLineWidth ( int )

   See also midLineWidth() and frameWidth().

  midLineWidth : int

   This property holds the width of the mid-line.

   The default value is 0.

   Access functions:
     * int midLineWidth () const
     * void setMidLineWidth ( int )

   See also lineWidth() and frameWidth().

Member Function Documentation

  QFrame::QFrame ( QWidget * parent = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   Constructs a frame widget with frame style NoFrame and a 1-pixel frame
   width.

   The parent and f arguments are passed to the QWidget constructor.

  QFrame::~QFrame ()

   Destroys the frame.

  int QFrame::frameStyle () const

   Returns the frame style.

   The default value is QFrame::NoFrame.

   See also setFrameStyle(), frameShape(), and frameShadow().

  void QFrame::setFrameStyle ( int style )

   Sets the frame style to style.

   The style is the bitwise OR between a frame shape and a frame shadow
   style. See the picture of the frames in the main class documentation.

   The frame shapes are given in QFrame::Shape and the shadow styles in
   QFrame::Shadow.

   If a mid-line width greater than 0 is specified, an additional line is
   drawn for Raised or Sunken Box, HLine, and VLine frames. The mid-color
   of the current color group is used for drawing middle lines.

   See also frameStyle().

Member Variable Documentation

  const int QFrame::Shadow_Mask

   The mask of the QFrame's shadow.

   See also QFrame::frameShadow.

  const int QFrame::Shape_Mask

   The mask of the QFrame's shape.

   See also QFrame::frameShape.
