Detailed Description

   The QSqlQuery class provides a means of executing and manipulating SQL
   statements.

   QSqlQuery encapsulates the functionality involved in creating,
   navigating and retrieving data from SQL queries which are executed on
   a QSqlDatabase. It can be used to execute DML (data manipulation
   language) statements, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, as
   well as DDL (data definition language) statements, such as CREATE
   TABLE. It can also be used to execute database-specific commands which
   are not standard SQL (e.g. SET DATESTYLE=ISO for PostgreSQL).

   Successfully executed SQL statements set the query's state to active;
   isActive() then returns true. Otherwise the query's state is set to
   inactive. In either case, when executing a new SQL statement, the
   query is positioned on an invalid record; an active query must be
   navigated to a valid record (so that isValid() returns true) before
   values can be retrieved.

   Navigating records is performed with the following functions:
     * next()
     * previous()
     * first()
     * last()
     * seek()

   These functions allow the programmer to move forward, backward or
   arbitrarily through the records returned by the query. If you only
   need to move forward through the results, e.g. using next() or using
   seek() with a positive offset, you can use setForwardOnly() and save a
   significant amount of memory overhead. Once an active query is
   positioned on a valid record, data can be retrieved using value(). All
   data is transferred from the SQL backend using QVariants.

   For example:
        QSqlQuery query("SELECT country FROM artist");
        while (query.next()) {
            QString country = query.value(0).toString();
            doSomething(country);
        }

   To access the data returned by a query, use value(int). Each field in
   the data returned by a SELECT statement is accessed by passing the
   field's position in the statement, starting from 0. This makes using
   SELECT * queries inadvisable because the order of the fields returned
   is indeterminate.

   For the sake of efficiency, there are no functions to access a field
   by name (unless you use prepared queries with names, as explained
   below). To convert a field name into an index, use record().indexOf(),
   for example:
        QSqlQuery query("SELECT * FROM artist");
        int fieldNo = query.record().indexOf("country");
        while (query.next()) {
            QString country = query.value(fieldNo).toString();
            doSomething(country);
        }

   QSqlQuery supports prepared query execution and the binding of
   parameter values to placeholders. Some databases don't support these
   features, so for those, Qt emulates the required functionality. For
   example, the Oracle and ODBC drivers have proper prepared query
   support, and Qt makes use of it; but for databases that don't have
   this support, Qt implements the feature itself, e.g. by replacing
   placeholders with actual values when a query is executed. Use
   numRowsAffected() to find out how many rows were affected by a
   non-SELECT query, and size() to find how many were retrieved by a
   SELECT.

   Oracle databases identify placeholders by using a colon-name syntax,
   e.g :name. ODBC simply uses ? characters. Qt supports both syntaxes,
   with the restriction that you can't mix them in the same query.

   You can retrieve the values of all the fields in a single variable (a
   map) using boundValues().

   Below we present the same example using each of the four different
   binding approaches, as well as one example of binding values to a
   stored procedure.

   Named binding using named placeholders:
        QSqlQuery query;
        query.prepare("INSERT INTO person (id, forename, surname) "
                      "VALUES (:id, :forename, :surname)");
        query.bindValue(":id", 1001);
        query.bindValue(":forename", "Bart");
        query.bindValue(":surname", "Simpson");
        query.exec();

   Positional binding using named placeholders:
        QSqlQuery query;
        query.prepare("INSERT INTO person (id, forename, surname) "
                      "VALUES (:id, :forename, :surname)");
        query.bindValue(0, 1001);
        query.bindValue(1, "Bart");
        query.bindValue(2, "Simpson");
        query.exec();

   Binding values using positional placeholders (version 1):
        QSqlQuery query;
        query.prepare("INSERT INTO person (id, forename, surname) "
                      "VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
        query.bindValue(0, 1001);
        query.bindValue(1, "Bart");
        query.bindValue(2, "Simpson");
        query.exec();

   Binding values using positional placeholders (version 2):
        QSqlQuery query;
        query.prepare("INSERT INTO person (id, forename, surname) "
                      "VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
        query.addBindValue(1001);
        query.addBindValue("Bart");
        query.addBindValue("Simpson");
        query.exec();

   Binding values to a stored procedure:

   This code calls a stored procedure called AsciiToInt(), passing it a
   character through its in parameter, and taking its result in the out
   parameter.
        QSqlQuery query;
        query.prepare("CALL AsciiToInt(?, ?)");
        query.bindValue(0, "A");
        query.bindValue(1, 0, QSql::Out);
        query.exec();
        int i = query.boundValue(1).toInt(); // i is 65

Member Function Documentation

  QSqlQuery::QSqlQuery ( QSqlResult * result )

   Constructs a QSqlQuery object which uses the QSqlResult result to
   communicate with a database.

  QSqlQuery::QSqlQuery ( const QString & query = QString(), QSqlDatabase db =
  QSqlDatabase() )

   Constructs a QSqlQuery object using the SQL query and the database db.
   If db is not specified, the application's default database is used. If
   query is not an empty string, it will be executed.

   See also QSqlDatabase.

  QSqlQuery::QSqlQuery ( QSqlDatabase db )

   Constructs a QSqlQuery object using the database db.

   See also QSqlDatabase.

  QSqlQuery::QSqlQuery ( const QSqlQuery & other )

   Constructs a copy of other.

  QSqlQuery::~QSqlQuery ()

   Destroys the object and frees any allocated resources.

  void QSqlQuery::addBindValue ( const QVariant & val, QSql::ParamType
  paramType = QSql::In )

   Adds the value val to the list of values when using positional value
   binding. The order of the addBindValue() calls determines which
   placeholder a value will be bound to in the prepared query. If
   paramType is QSql::Out or QSql::InOut, the placeholder will be
   overwritten with data from the database after the exec() call.

   See also bindValue(), prepare(), exec(), boundValue(), and
   boundValues().

  int QSqlQuery::at () const

   Returns the current internal position of the query. The first record
   is at position zero. If the position is invalid, the function returns
   QSql::BeforeFirstRow or QSql::AfterLastRow, which are special negative
   values.

   See also previous(), next(), first(), last(), seek(), isActive(), and
   isValid().

  void QSqlQuery::bindValue ( const QString & placeholder, const QVariant &
  val, QSql::ParamType paramType = QSql::In )

   Set the placeholder placeholder to be bound to value val in the
   prepared statement. Note that the placeholder mark (e.g :) must be
   included when specifying the placeholder name. If paramType is
   QSql::Out or QSql::InOut, the placeholder will be overwritten with
   data from the database after the exec() call.

   See also addBindValue(), prepare(), exec(), boundValue(), and
   boundValues().

  void QSqlQuery::bindValue ( int pos, const QVariant & val, QSql::ParamType
  paramType = QSql::In )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Set the placeholder in position pos to be bound to value val in the
   prepared statement. Field numbering starts at 0. If paramType is
   QSql::Out or QSql::InOut, the placeholder will be overwritten with
   data from the database after the exec() call.

  QVariant QSqlQuery::boundValue ( const QString & placeholder ) const

   Returns the value for the placeholder.

   See also boundValues(), bindValue(), and addBindValue().

  QVariant QSqlQuery::boundValue ( int pos ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the value for the placeholder at position pos.

  QMap<QString, QVariant> QSqlQuery::boundValues () const

   Returns a map of the bound values.

   With named binding, the bound values can be examined in the following
   ways:
        QMapIterator<QString, QVariant> i(query.boundValues());
        while (i.hasNext()) {
            i.next();
            cout << i.key().toAscii().data() << ": "
                 << i.value().toString().toAscii().data() << endl;
        }

   With positional binding, the code becomes:
        QList<QVariant> list = query.boundValues().values();
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); ++i)
            cout << i << ": " << list.at(i).toString().toAscii().data() << endl
;

   See also boundValue(), bindValue(), and addBindValue().

  void QSqlQuery::clear ()

   Clears the result set and releases any resources held by the query.
   You should rarely if ever need to call this function.

  const QSqlDriver * QSqlQuery::driver () const

   Returns the database driver associated with the query.

  bool QSqlQuery::exec ( const QString & query )

   Executes the SQL in query. Returns true and sets the query state to
   active if the query was successful; otherwise returns false. The query
   string must use syntax appropriate for the SQL database being queried
   (for example, standard SQL).

   After the query is executed, the query is positioned on an invalid
   record and must be navigated to a valid record before data values can
   be retrieved (for example, using next()).

   Note that the last error for this query is reset when exec() is
   called.

   Example:
        QSqlQuery query("SELECT country FROM artist");
        while (query.next()) {
            QString country = query.value(0).toString();
            doSomething(country);
        }

   See also isActive(), isValid(), next(), previous(), first(), last(),
   and seek().

  bool QSqlQuery::exec ()

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Executes a previously prepared SQL query. Returns true if the query
   executed successfully; otherwise returns false.

   See also prepare(), bindValue(), addBindValue(), boundValue(), and
   boundValues().

  QString QSqlQuery::executedQuery () const

   Returns the last query that was executed.

   In most cases this function returns the same string as lastQuery(). If
   a prepared query with placeholders is executed on a DBMS that does not
   support it, the preparation of this query is emulated. The
   placeholders in the original query are replaced with their bound
   values to form a new query. This function returns the modified query.
   It is mostly useful for debugging purposes.

   See also lastQuery().

  bool QSqlQuery::first ()

   Retrieves the first record in the result, if available, and positions
   the query on the retrieved record. Note that the result must be in an
   active state and isSelect() must return true before calling this
   function or it will do nothing and return false. Returns true if
   successful. If unsuccessful the query position is set to an invalid
   position and false is returned.

   See also next(), previous(), last(), seek(), at(), isActive(), and
   isValid().

  bool QSqlQuery::isActive () const

   Returns true if the query is currently active; otherwise returns
   false.

  bool QSqlQuery::isForwardOnly () const

   Returns true if you can only scroll forward through a result set;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also setForwardOnly() and next().

  bool QSqlQuery::isNull ( int field ) const

   Returns true if the query is active and positioned on a valid record
   and the field is NULL; otherwise returns false. Note that for some
   drivers, isNull() will not return accurate information until after an
   attempt is made to retrieve data.

   See also isActive(), isValid(), and value().

  bool QSqlQuery::isSelect () const

   Returns true if the current query is a SELECT statement; otherwise
   returns false.

  bool QSqlQuery::isValid () const

   Returns true if the query is currently positioned on a valid record;
   otherwise returns false.

  bool QSqlQuery::last ()

   Retrieves the last record in the result, if available, and positions
   the query on the retrieved record. Note that the result must be in an
   active state and isSelect() must return true before calling this
   function or it will do nothing and return false. Returns true if
   successful. If unsuccessful the query position is set to an invalid
   position and false is returned.

   See also next(), previous(), first(), seek(), at(), isActive(), and
   isValid().

  QSqlError QSqlQuery::lastError () const

   Returns error information about the last error (if any) that occurred.

   See also QSqlError.

  QVariant QSqlQuery::lastInsertId () const

   Returns the object ID of the most recent inserted row if the database
   supports it. An invalid QVariant will be returned if the query did not
   insert any value or if the database does not report the id back. If
   more than one row was touched by the insert, the behavior is
   undefined.

   See also QSqlDriver::hasFeature().

  QString QSqlQuery::lastQuery () const

   Returns the text of the current query being used, or an empty string
   if there is no current query text.

   See also executedQuery().

  bool QSqlQuery::next ()

   Retrieves the next record in the result, if available, and positions
   the query on the retrieved record. Note that the result must be in an
   active state and isSelect() must return true before calling this
   function or it will do nothing and return false.

   The following rules apply:
     * If the result is currently located before the first record, e.g.
       immediately after a query is executed, an attempt is made to
       retrieve the first record.
     * If the result is currently located after the last record, there is
       no change and false is returned.
     * If the result is located somewhere in the middle, an attempt is
       made to retrieve the next record.

   If the record could not be retrieved, the result is positioned after
   the last record and false is returned. If the record is successfully
   retrieved, true is returned.

   See also previous(), first(), last(), seek(), at(), isActive(), and
   isValid().

  int QSqlQuery::numRowsAffected () const

   Returns the number of rows affected by the result's SQL statement, or
   -1 if it cannot be determined. Note that for SELECT statements, the
   value is undefined; use size() instead. If the query is not active
   (isActive() returns false), -1 is returned.

   See also size() and QSqlDriver::hasFeature().

  bool QSqlQuery::prepare ( const QString & query )

   Prepares the SQL query query for execution. The query may contain
   placeholders for binding values. Both Oracle style colon-name (e.g.,
   :surname), and ODBC style (?) placeholders are supported; but they
   cannot be mixed in the same query. See the Detailed Description for
   examples.

   See also exec(), bindValue(), and addBindValue().

  bool QSqlQuery::previous ()

   Retrieves the previous record in the result, if available, and
   positions the query on the retrieved record. Note that the result must
   be in an active state and isSelect() must return true before calling
   this function or it will do nothing and return false.

   The following rules apply:
     * If the result is currently located before the first record, there
       is no change and false is returned.
     * If the result is currently located after the last record, an
       attempt is made to retrieve the last record.
     * If the result is somewhere in the middle, an attempt is made to
       retrieve the previous record.

   If the record could not be retrieved, the result is positioned before
   the first record and false is returned. If the record is successfully
   retrieved, true is returned.

   See also next(), first(), last(), seek(), at(), isActive(), and
   isValid().

  QSqlRecord QSqlQuery::record () const

   Returns a QSqlRecord containing the field information for the current
   query. If the query points to a valid row (isValid() returns true),
   the record is populated with the row's values. An empty record is
   returned when there is no active query (isActive() returns false).

   To retrieve values from a query, value() should be used since its
   index-based lookup is faster.

   In the following example, a SELECT * FROM query is executed. Since the
   order of the columns is not defined, QSqlRecord::indexOf() is used to
   obtain the index of a column.
    QSqlQuery q("select * from employees");
    QSqlRecord rec = q.record();

    qDebug() << "Number of columns: " << rec.count();

    int nameCol = rec.indexOf("name"); // index of the field "name"
    while (q.next())
        qDebug() << q.value(nameCol).toString(); // output all names

   See also value().

  const QSqlResult * QSqlQuery::result () const

   Returns the result associated with the query.

  bool QSqlQuery::seek ( int index, bool relative = false )

   Retrieves the record at position index, if available, and positions
   the query on the retrieved record. The first record is at position 0.
   Note that the query must be in an active state and isSelect() must
   return true before calling this function.

   If relative is false (the default), the following rules apply:
     * If index is negative, the result is positioned before the first
       record and false is returned.
     * Otherwise, an attempt is made to move to the record at position
       index. If the record at position index could not be retrieved, the
       result is positioned after the last record and false is returned.
       If the record is successfully retrieved, true is returned.

   If relative is true, the following rules apply:
     * If the result is currently positioned before the first record or
       on the first record, and index is negative, there is no change,
       and false is returned.
     * If the result is currently located after the last record, and
       index is positive, there is no change, and false is returned.
     * If the result is currently located somewhere in the middle, and
       the relative offset index moves the result below zero, the result
       is positioned before the first record and false is returned.
     * Otherwise, an attempt is made to move to the record index records
       ahead of the current record (or index records behind the current
       record if index is negative). If the record at offset index could
       not be retrieved, the result is positioned after the last record
       if index >= 0, (or before the first record if index is negative),
       and false is returned. If the record is successfully retrieved,
       true is returned.

   See also next(), previous(), first(), last(), at(), isActive(), and
   isValid().

  void QSqlQuery::setForwardOnly ( bool forward )

   Sets forward only mode to forward. If forward is true, only next() and
   seek() with positive values, are allowed for navigating the results.
   Forward only mode needs far less memory since results do not need to
   be cached.

   Forward only mode is off by default.

   See also isForwardOnly(), next(), and seek().

  int QSqlQuery::size () const

   Returns the size of the result (number of rows returned), or -1 if the
   size cannot be determined or if the database does not support
   reporting information about query sizes. Note that for non-SELECT
   statements (isSelect() returns false), size() will return -1. If the
   query is not active (isActive() returns false), -1 is returned.

   To determine the number of rows affected by a non-SELECT statement,
   use numRowsAffected().

   See also isActive(), numRowsAffected(), and QSqlDriver::hasFeature().

  QVariant QSqlQuery::value ( int index ) const

   Returns the value of field index in the current record.

   The fields are numbered from left to right using the text of the
   SELECT statement, e.g. in
    SELECT forename, surname FROM people;

   field 0 is forename and field 1 is surname. Using SELECT * is not
   recommended because the order of the fields in the query is undefined.

   An invalid QVariant is returned if field index does not exist, if the
   query is inactive, or if the query is positioned on an invalid record.

   See also previous(), next(), first(), last(), seek(), isActive(), and
   isValid().

  QSqlQuery & QSqlQuery::operator= ( const QSqlQuery & other )

   Assigns other to this object.
