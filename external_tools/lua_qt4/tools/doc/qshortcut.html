Detailed Description

   The QShortcut class is used to create keyboard shortcuts.

   The QShortcut class provides a way of connecting keyboard shortcuts to
   Qt's signals and slots mechanism, so that objects can be informed when
   a shortcut is executed. The shortcut can be set up to contain all the
   key presses necessary to describe a keyboard shortcut, including the
   states of modifier keys such as Shift, Ctrl, and Alt.

   For applications that use menus, it may be more convenient to use the
   convenience functions provided in the QMenu class to assign keyboard
   shortcuts to menu items as they are created. Alternatively, shortcuts
   may be associated with other types of actions in the QAction class.

   The simplest way to create a shortcut for a particular widget is to
   construct the shortcut with a key sequence. For example:
    shortcut = QShortcut(QKeySequence(tr("Ctrl+O", "File|Open")),
                         parent);

   When the user types the key sequence for a given shortcut, the
   shortcut's activated() signal is emitted. (In the case of ambiguity,
   the activatedAmbiguously() signal is emitted.) A shortcut is "listened
   for" by Qt's event loop when the shortcut's parent widget is receiving
   events.

   A shortcut's key sequence can be set with setKey() and retrieved with
   key(). A shortcut can be enabled or disabled with setEnabled(), and
   can have "What's This?" help text set with setWhatsThis().

   See also QShortcutEvent, QKeySequence, and QAction.

Property Documentation

  context : Qt::ShortcutContext

   This property holds the context in which the shortcut is valid.

   A shortcut's context decides in which circumstances a shortcut is
   allowed to be triggered. The normal context is Qt::WindowShortcut,
   which allows the shortcut to trigger if the parent (the widget
   containing the shortcut) is a subwidget of the active top-level
   window.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::ShortcutContext context ()
     * void setContext ( Qt::ShortcutContext context )

  enabled : bool

   This property holds whether the shortcut is enabled.

   An enabled shortcut emits the activated() or activatedAmbiguously()
   signal when a QShortcutEvent occurs that matches the shortcut's key()
   sequence.

   If the application is in WhatsThis mode the shortcut will not emit the
   signals, but will show the "What's This?" text instead.

   Access functions:
     * bool isEnabled () const
     * void setEnabled ( bool enable )

   See also whatsThis.

  key : QKeySequence

   This property holds the shortcut's key sequence.

   This is a key sequence with an optional combination of Shift, Ctrl,
   and Alt. The key sequence may be supplied in a number of ways:
    setKey(0);                  // no signal emitted
    setKey(QKeySequence());     // no signal emitted
    setKey(0x3b1);              // Greek letter alpha
    setKey(Qt::Key_D);              // 'd', e.g. to delete
    setKey('q');                // 'q', e.g. to quit
    setKey(Qt::CTRL + Qt::Key_P);       // Ctrl+P, e.g. to print document
    setKey("Ctrl+P");           // Ctrl+P, e.g. to print document

   Access functions:
     * QKeySequence key () const
     * void setKey ( const QKeySequence & key )

  whatsThis : QString

   This property holds the shortcut's "What's This?" help text.

   The text will be shown when the application is in "What's This?" mode
   and the user types the shortcut key() sequence.

   To set "What's This?" help on a menu item (with or without a shortcut
   key), set the help on the item's action.

   Access functions:
     * QString whatsThis () const
     * void setWhatsThis ( const QString & text )

   See also QWhatsThis::inWhatsThisMode() and QAction::setWhatsThis().

Member Function Documentation

  QShortcut::QShortcut ( QWidget * parent )

   Constructs a QShortcut object for the parent widget. Since no shortcut
   key sequence is specified, the shortcut will not emit any signals.

   See also setKey().

  QShortcut::QShortcut ( const QKeySequence & key, QWidget * parent, const char
  * member = 0, const char * ambiguousMember = 0, Qt::ShortcutContext context =
  Qt::WindowShortcut )

   Constructs a QShortcut object for the parent widget. The shortcut
   operates on its parent, listening for QShortcutEvents that match the
   key sequence. Depending on the ambiguity of the event, the shortcut
   will call the member function, or the ambiguousMember function, if the
   key press was in the shortcut's context.

  QShortcut::~QShortcut ()

   Destroys the shortcut.

  void QShortcut::activated ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the user types the shortcut's key
   sequence.

   See also activatedAmbiguously().

  void QShortcut::activatedAmbiguously ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the user types a shortcut key sequence
   that is ambiguous. For example, if one key sequence is a "prefix" for
   another and the user types these keys it isn't clear if they want the
   shorter key sequence, or if they're about to type more to complete the
   longer key sequence.

   See also activated().

  int QShortcut::id () const

   Returns the shortcut's ID.

   See also QShortcutEvent::shortcutId().

  QWidget * QShortcut::parentWidget () const

   Returns the shortcut's parent widget.
