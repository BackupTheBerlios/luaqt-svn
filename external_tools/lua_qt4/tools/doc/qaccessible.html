Detailed Description

   The QAccessible class provides enums and static functions relating to
   accessibility.

   Accessible applications can be used by people who are not able to use
   applications by conventional means.

   The functions in this class are used for communication between
   accessible applications (also called AT Servers) and accessibility
   tools (AT Clients), such as screen readers and braille displays.
   Clients and servers communicate in the following way:
     * AT Servers notify the clients about events through calls to the
       updateAccessibility() function.
     * AT Clients request information about the objects in the server.
       The QAccessibleInterface class is the core interface, and
       encapsulates this information in a pure virtual API.
       Implementations of the interface are provided by Qt through the
       queryAccessibleInterface() API.

   The communication between servers and clients is initialized by the
   setRootObject() function. Function pointers can be installed to
   replace or extend the default behavior of the static functions in
   QAccessible.

   Qt supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), Mac OS X
   Accessibility, and the Unix/X11 AT-SPI standard. Other backends can be
   supported using QAccessibilityBridge.

   In addition to QAccessible's static functions, Qt offers one generic
   interface, QAccessibleInterface, that can be used to wrap all widgets
   and objects (e.g., QPushButton). This single interface provides all
   the metadata necessary for the assistive technologies. Qt provides
   implementations of this interface for its built-in widgets as plugins.

   When you develop custom widgets, you can create custom subclasses of
   QAccessibleInterface and distribute them as plugins (using
   QAccessiblePlugin) or compile them into the application. Likewise,
   Qt's predefined accessibility support can be built as plugin (the
   default) or directly into the Qt library. The main advantage of using
   plugins is that the accessibility classes are only loaded into memory
   if they are actually used; they don't slow down the common case where
   no assistive technology is being used.

   Qt also includes two convenience classes, QAccessibleObject and
   QAccessibleWidget, that inherit from QAccessibleInterface and provide
   the lowest common denominator of metadata (e.g., widget geometry,
   window title, basic help text). You can use them as base classes when
   wrapping your custom QObject or QWidget subclasses.

   See also QAccessibleInterface.

  typedef QAccessible::InterfaceFactory

   A function pointer type. Use a function with this prototype to install
   interface factories with installFactory().

   The function receives a QObject pointer. If the QObject provides a
   QAccessibleInterface, it sets the second parameter to point to the
   corresponding QAccessibleInterface, and returns true; otherwise
   returns false.

   Installed factories are called by queryAccessibilityInterface() until
   one provides an interface.

  enum QAccessible::RelationFlag
  flags QAccessible::Relation

   relationship between two accessible objects.

   the second object.

   Implementations of relationTo() return a combination of these flags.
   Some values are mutually exclusive.

   Implementations of navigate() can accept only one distinct value.

   The Relation type is a typedef for QFlags<RelationFlag>. It stores an
   OR combination of RelationFlag values.

     _________________________________________________________________

Member Function Documentation

  void QAccessible::installFactory ( InterfaceFactory factory )   [static]

   Installs the InterfaceFactory factory. The last factory added is the
   first one used by queryAccessibleInterface().

  RootObjectHandler QAccessible::installRootObjectHandler ( RootObjectHandler
  handler )   [static]

   Installs the given handler as the function to be used by
   setRootObject(), and returns the previously installed handler.

  UpdateHandler QAccessible::installUpdateHandler ( UpdateHandler handler )
  [static]

   Installs the given handler as the function to be used by
   updateAccessibility(), and returns the previously installed handler.

  bool QAccessible::isActive ()   [static]

   Returns true if an accessibility implementation has been requested
   during the runtime of the application; otherwise returns false.

   Use this function to prevent potentially expensive notifications via
   updateAccessibility().

  QAccessibleInterface * QAccessible::queryAccessibleInterface ( QObject *
  object )   [static]

   If a QAccessibleInterface implementation exists for the given object,
   this function returns a pointer to the implementation; otherwise it
   returns 0.

   The function calls all installed factory functions (from most recently
   installed to least recently installed) until one is found that
   provides an interface for the class of object. If no factory can
   provide an accessibility implementation for the class the function
   loads installed accessibility plugins, and tests if any of the plugins
   can provide the implementation.

   If no implementation for the object's class is available, the function
   tries to find an implementation for the object's parent class, using
   the above strategy.

   Warning: The caller is responsible for deleting the returned interface
   after use.

  void QAccessible::removeFactory ( InterfaceFactory factory )   [static]

   Removes factory from the list of installed InterfaceFactories.

  void QAccessible::setRootObject ( QObject * object )   [static]

   Sets the root accessible object of this application to object. All
   other accessible objects in the application can be reached by the
   client using object navigation.

   You should never need to call this function. Qt sets the QApplication
   object as the root object immediately before the event loop is entered
   in QApplication::exec().

   Use installRootObjectHandler() to redirect the function call to a
   customized handler function.

   See also RootObjectHandler and queryAccessibleInterface().

  void QAccessible::updateAccessibility ( QObject * object, int child, Event
  reason )   [static]

   Notifies accessibility clients about a change in object's
   accessibility information.

   reason specifies the cause of the change, for example, ValueChange
   when the position of a slider has been changed. child is the (1-based)
   index of the child element that has changed. When child is 0, the
   object itself has changed.

   Call this function whenever the state of your accessible object or one
   of it's sub-elements has been changed either programmatically (e.g. by
   calling QLabel::setText()) or by user interaction.

   If there are no accessibility tools listening to this event, the
   performance penalty for calling this function is small, but if
   determining the parameters of the call is expensive you can test
   isActive() to avoid unnecessary computations.
