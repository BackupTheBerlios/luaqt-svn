Detailed Description

   The QFileDialog class provides a dialog that allow users to select
   files or directories.

   The QFileDialog class enables a user to traverse the file system in
   order to select one or many files or a directory.

   The easiest way to create a QFileDialog is to use the static
   functions. On Windows, these static functions will call the native
   Windows file dialog, and on Mac OS X these static function will call
   the native Mac OS X file dialog.
    QString s = QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(
                    this,
                    "Choose a file",
                    "/home",
                    "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)");

   In the above example, a modal QFileDialog is created using a static
   function. The dialog initially displays the contents of the "/home"
   directory, and displays files matching the patterns given in the
   string "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)". The parent of the file dialog is
   set to this, and the dialog is named "open file dialog". The caption
   at the top of file dialog is set to "Choose a file" instead of the
   default.

   If you want to use multiple filters, separate each one with two
   semicolons. For example:
    "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg);;Text files (*.txt);;XML files (*.xml)"

   You can create your own QFileDialog without using the static
   functions. By calling setMode(), you can specify what the user must
   select in the dialog:
      QFileDialog *fd = new QFileDialog(this);
      fd->setMode(QFileDialog::AnyFile);

   In the above example, the mode of the file dialog is set to AnyFile,
   meaning that the user can select any file, or even specify a file that
   doesn't exist. This mode is useful for creating a "Save As" file
   dialog. Use ExistingFile if the user must select an existing file, or
   Directory if only a directory may be selected. See the
   QFileDialog::FileMode enum for the complete list of modes.

   You can retrieve the dialog's mode with mode(). Use setFilter() to set
   the dialog's file filter. For example:
      fd->setFilter( "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)" );

   In the above example, the filter is set to "Images (*.png *.xpm
   *.jpg)", this means that only files with the extension png, xpm, or
   jpg will be shown in the QFileDialog. You can apply several filters by
   using setFilters(). Use selectFilter() to select one of the filters
   you've given as the file dialog's default filter.

   The file dialog has two view modes: QFileDialog::List and
   QFileDialog::Detail. QFileDialog::List presents the contents of the
   current directory as a list of file and directory names.
   QFileDialog::Detail also displays a list of file and directory names,
   but provides additional information alongside each name, such as the
   file size and modification date. Set the mode with setViewMode().
      fd->setViewMode(QFileDialog::Detail);

   The last important function you will need to use when creating your
   own file dialog is selectedFiles().
      QStringList fileNames;
      if (fileDialog->exec())
          fileNames = fileNames->selectedFiles();

   In the above example, a modal file dialog is created and shown. If the
   user clicked OK, the file they selected is put in fileName.

   The dialog's working directory can be set with setDirectory(). Each
   file in the current directory can be selected using the selectFile()
   function.

   The Standard Dialogs example shows how to use QFileDialog as well as
   other built-in Qt dialogs.

Member Function Documentation

  QFileDialog::QFileDialog ( QWidget * parent, Qt::WFlags flags )

   Constructs a file dialog with the given parent and widget flags.

  QFileDialog::QFileDialog ( QWidget * parent = 0, const QString & caption =
  QString(), const QString & directory = QString(), const QString & filter =
  QString() )

   Constructs a file dialog with the given parent and caption that
   initially displays the contents of the specified directory. The
   contents of the directory are filtered before being shown in the
   dialog, using a semicolon-separated list of filters specified by
   filter.

  QFileDialog::~QFileDialog ()

  void QFileDialog::currentChanged ( const QString & path )   [signal]

   When the current file changes, this signal is emitted with the new
   file name as the path parameter.

   See also filesSelected().

  QDir QFileDialog::directory () const

   Returns the directory currently being displayed in the dialog.

  void QFileDialog::filesSelected ( const QStringList & selected )   [signal]

   When the selection changes, this signal is emitted with the (possibly
   empty) list of selected files.

   See also currentChanged().

  QStringList QFileDialog::filters () const

   Returns the file type filters that are in operation on this file
   dialog.

  QString QFileDialog::getExistingDirectory ( QWidget * parent = 0, const
  QString & caption = QString(), const QString & dir = QString(), Options
  options = ShowDirsOnly )   [static]

   This is a convenience static function that will return an existing
   directory selected by the user.
    QString s = QFileDialog::getExistingDirectory(
                    this,
                    "Choose a directory",
                    "/home",
                    DontResolveSymlinks);

   This function creates a modal file dialog with the given parent
   widget. If the parent is not 0, the dialog will be shown centered over
   the parent widget.

   The dialog's working directory is set to dir, and the caption is set
   to caption. Either of these may be an empty string in which case the
   current directory and a default caption will be used respectively. The
   options argument holds various options about how to run the dialog,
   see the QFileDialog::Option enum for more information on the flags you
   can pass.

   Under Unix/X11, the normal behavior of the file dialog is to resolve
   and follow symlinks. For example, if /usr/tmp is a symlink to
   /var/tmp, the file dialog will change to /var/tmp after entering
   /usr/tmp. If options includes DontResolveSymlinks, the file dialog
   will treat symlinks as regular directories.

   Note that on Windows the dialog will spin a blocking modal event loop
   that will not dispatch any QTimers, and if parent is not 0 then it
   will position the dialog just under the parent's title bar.

   See also getOpenFileName(), getOpenFileNames(), and getSaveFileName().

  QString QFileDialog::getOpenFileName ( QWidget * parent = 0, const QString &
  caption = QString(), const QString & dir = QString(), const QString & filter
  = QString(), QString * selectedFilter = 0, Options options = 0 )   [static]

   This is a convenience static function that returns an existing file
   selected by the user. If the user presses Cancel, it returns a null
   string.
    QString s = QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(
                    this,
                    "Choose a file to open",
                    "/home",
                    "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)");

   The function creates a modal file dialog with the given parent widget.
   If the parent is not 0, the dialog will be shown centered over the
   parent widget.

   The file dialog's working directory will be set to dir. If dir
   includes a file name, the file will be selected. Only files that match
   the given filter are shown. The filter selected is set to
   selectedFilter. The parameters dir, selectedFilter, and filter may be
   empty strings. The options argument holds various options about how to
   run the dialog, see the QFileDialog::Option enum for more information
   on the flags you can pass.

   The dialog's caption is set to caption. If caption is not specified
   then a default caption will be used.

   Under Windows and Mac OS X, this static function will use the native
   file dialog and not a QFileDialog.

   Note that on Windows the dialog will spin a blocking modal event loop
   that will not dispatch any QTimers, and if parent is not 0 then it
   will position the dialog just under the parent's title bar.

   Under Unix/X11, the normal behavior of the file dialog is to resolve
   and follow symlinks. For example, if /usr/tmp is a symlink to
   /var/tmp, the file dialog will change to /var/tmp after entering
   /usr/tmp. If options includes DontResolveSymlinks, the file dialog
   will treat symlinks as regular directories.

   getExistingDirectory().

  QStringList QFileDialog::getOpenFileNames ( QWidget * parent = 0, const
  QString & caption = QString(), const QString & dir = QString(), const QString
  & filter = QString(), QString * selectedFilter = 0, Options options = 0 )
  [static]

   This is a convenience static function that will return one or more
   existing files selected by the user.
    QStringList files = QFileDialog::getOpenFileNames(
                            this,
                            "Select one or more files to open",
                            "/home",
                            "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)");

   This function creates a modal file dialog with the given parent
   widget. If the parent is not 0, the dialog will be shown centered over
   the parent widget.

   The file dialog's working directory will be set to dir. If dir
   includes a file name, the file will be selected. The filter is set to
   filter so that only those files which match the filter are shown. The
   filter selected is set to selectedFilter. The parameters dir,
   selectedFilter and filter may be empty strings.

   The dialog's caption is set to caption. If caption is not specified
   then a default caption will be used.

   Under Windows and Mac OS X, this static function will use the native
   file dialog and not a QFileDialog.

   Note that on Windows the dialog will spin a blocking modal event loop
   that will not dispatch any QTimers, and if parent is not 0 then it
   will position the dialog just under the parent's title bar.

   /usr/tmp. The options argument holds various options about how to run
   the dialog, see the QFileDialog::Option enum for more information on
   the flags you can pass.

   Note that if you want to iterate over the list of files, you should
   iterate over a copy. For example:
    QStringList list = files;
    QStringList::Iterator it = list.begin();
    while(it != list.end()) {
        myProcessing(*it);
        ++it;
    }

  QString QFileDialog::getSaveFileName ( QWidget * parent = 0, const QString &
  caption = QString(), const QString & dir = QString(), const QString & filter
  = QString(), QString * selectedFilter = 0, Options options = 0 )   [static]

   This is a convenience static function that will return a file name
   selected by the user. The file does not have to exist.

   It creates a modal file dialog with the given parent widget. If the
   parent is not 0, the dialog will be shown centered over the parent
   widget.
    QString s = QFileDialog::getSaveFileName(
                    this,
                    "Choose a filename to save under",
                    "/home",
                    "Images (*.png *.xpm *.jpg)");

   The file dialog's working directory will be set to dir. If dir
   includes a file name, the file will be selected. Only files that match
   the filter are shown. The filter selected is set to selectedFilter.
   The parameters dir, selectedFilter, and filter may be empty strings.
   The options argument holds various options about how to run the
   dialog, see the QFileDialog::Option enum for more information on the
   flags you can pass.

   The dialog's caption is set to caption. If caption is not specified
   then a default caption will be used.

   Under Windows and Mac OS X, this static function will use the native
   file dialog and not a QFileDialog.

   Note that on Windows the dialog will spin a blocking modal event loop
   that will not dispatch any QTimers, and if parent is not 0 then it
   will position the dialog just under the parent's title bar. On Mac OS
   X, the filter argument is ignored.

   Under Unix/X11, the normal behavior of the file dialog is to resolve
   and follow symlinks. For example, if /usr/tmp is a symlink to
   /var/tmp, the file dialog will change to /var/tmp after entering
   /usr/tmp. If options includes DontResolveSymlinks, the file dialog
   will treat symlinks as regular directories.

   Selects the given filename in both the file dialog.

  void QFileDialog::selectFilter ( const QString & filter )

   Sets the current file type filter. Multiple filters can be passed in
   filter by separating them with semicolons or spaces.

   See also setFilter() and setFilters().

  QStringList QFileDialog::selectedFiles () const

   Returns a list of strings containing the absolute paths of the
   selected files in the dialog. If no files are selected, or the mode is
   not ExistingFiles, selectedFiles() is an empty string list.

   See also selectedFilter().

  QString QFileDialog::selectedFilter () const

   Returns the filter that the user selected in the file dialog.

   See also selectedFiles().

  void QFileDialog::setDirectory ( const QString & directory )

   Sets the file dialog's current directory.

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  void QFileDialog::setFilter ( const QString & filter )

   Sets the filter used in the file dialog to the given filter.

   If filter contains a pair of parentheses containing one or more of
   anything*something, separated by spaces or by semicolons then only the
   text contained in the parentheses is used as the filter. This means
   that these calls are all equivalent:
    fd->setFilter("All C++ files (*.cpp *.cc *.C *.cxx *.c++)");
    fd->setFilter("*.cpp *.cc *.C *.cxx *.c++");
    fd->setFilter("All C++ files (*.cpp;*.cc;*.C;*.cxx;*.c++)");
