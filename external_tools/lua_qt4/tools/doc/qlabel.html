Detailed Description

   The QLabel widget provides a text or image display.

   QLabel is used for displaying text or an image. No user interaction
   functionality is provided. The visual appearance of the label can be
   configured in various ways, and it can be used for specifying a focus
   mnemonic key for another widget.

   A QLabel can contain any of the following content types:

                              Content Setting
                  Plain text Pass a QString to setText().
       Rich text Pass a QString that contains rich text to setText().
                  A pixmap Pass a QPixmap to setPixmap().
                    A movie Pass a QMovie to setMovie().
      A number Pass an int or a double to setNum(), which converts the
                           number to plain text.
    Nothing The same as an empty plain text. This is the default. Set by
                                  clear().

   When the content is changed using any of these functions, any previous
   content is cleared.

   The look of a QLabel can be tuned in several ways. All the settings of
   QFrame are available for specifying a widget frame. The positioning of
   the content within the QLabel widget area can be tuned with
   setAlignment() and setIndent(). Text content can also wrap lines along
   word bounderies with setWordWrap(). For example, this code sets up a
   sunken panel with a two-line text in the bottom right corner (both
   lines being flush with the right side of the label):
    QLabel *label = new QLabel(this);
    label->setFrameStyle(QFrame::Panel | QFrame::Sunken);
    label->setText("first line\nsecond line");
    label->setAlignment(Qt::AlignBottom | Qt::AlignRight);

   A QLabel is often used as a label for an interactive widget. For this
   use QLabel provides a useful mechanism for adding an mnemonic (see
   QKeysequence) that will set the keyboard focus to the other widget
   (called the QLabel's "buddy"). For example:
    QLineEdit* phoneEdit = new QLineEdit(this);
    QLabel* phoneLabel = new QLabel("&Phone:", this);
    phoneLabel->setBuddy(phoneEdit);

   In this example, keyboard focus is transferred to the label's buddy
   (the QLineEdit) when the user presses Alt+P. If the buddy was a button
   (inheriting from QAbstractButton), triggering the mnemonic would
   emulate a button click.

Property Documentation

  alignment : Qt::Alignment

   This property holds the alignment of the label's contents.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::Alignment alignment () const
     * void setAlignment ( Qt::Alignment )

   See also text.

  indent : int

   This property holds the label's text indent in pixels.

   If a label displays text, the indent applies to the left edge if
   alignment() is Qt::AlignLeft, to the right edge if alignment() is
   Qt::AlignRight, to the top edge if alignment() is Qt::AlignTop, and to
   to the bottom edge if alignment() is Qt::AlignBottom.

   If indent is negative, or if no indent has been set, the label
   computes the effective indent as follows: If frameWidth() is 0, the
   effective indent becomes 0. If frameWidth() is greater than 0, the
   effective indent becomes half the width of the "x" character of the
   widget's current font().

   Access functions:
     * int indent () const
     * void setIndent ( int )

   See also alignment, margin, frameWidth(), and font().

  margin : int

   This property holds the width of the margin.

   The margin is the distance between the innermost pixel of the frame
   and the outermost pixel of contents.

   The default margin is 0.

   Access functions:
     * int margin () const
     * void setMargin ( int )

   See also indent.

  pixmap : QPixmap

   This property holds the label's pixmap.

   If no pixmap has been set this will return an invalid pixmap.

   Setting the pixmap clears any previous content. The buddy shortcut, if
   any, is disabled.

   Access functions:
     * const QPixmap * pixmap () const
     * void setPixmap ( const QPixmap & )

  scaledContents : bool

   This property holds whether the label will scale its contents to fill
   all available space.

   When enabled and the label shows a pixmap, it will scale the pixmap to
   fill the available space.

   This property's default is false.

   Access functions:
     * bool hasScaledContents () const
     * void setScaledContents ( bool )

  text : QString

   This property holds the label's text.

   If no text has been set this will return an empty string. Setting the
   text clears any previous content, unless they are the same.

   The text will be interpreted either as a plain text or as a rich text,
   depending on the text format setting; see setTextFormat(). The default
   setting is Qt::AutoText, i.e. QLabel will try to auto-detect the
   format of the text set.

   If the text is interpreted as a plain text and a buddy has been set,
   the buddy mnemonic key is updated from the new text.

   The label resizes itself if auto-resizing is enabled.

   Note that Qlabel is well-suited to display small rich text documents,
   i.e. those small documents that get their document specific settings
   (font, text color, link color) from the label's palette and font
   properties. For large documents, use QTextEdit in read-only mode
   instead. QTextEdit will flicker less on resize and can also provide a
   scrollbar when necessary.

   Access functions:
     * QString text () const
     * void setText ( const QString & )

   See also setTextFormat(), setBuddy(), and alignment.

  textFormat : Qt::TextFormat

   This property holds the label's text format.

   See the Qt::TextFormat enum for an explanation of the possible
   options.

   The default format is Qt::AutoText.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::TextFormat textFormat () const
     * void setTextFormat ( Qt::TextFormat )

   See also text().

  wordWrap : bool

   This property holds the label's word-wrapping policy.

   If this property is true then label text is wrapped where necessary at
   word-breaks; otherwise it is not wrapped at all.

   Access functions:
     * bool wordWrap () const
     * void setWordWrap ( bool on )

Member Function Documentation

  QLabel::QLabel ( QWidget * parent = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   Constructs an empty label.

   The parent and widget flag f, arguments are passed to the QFrame
   constructor.

   See also setAlignment(), setFrameStyle(), and setIndent().

  QLabel::QLabel ( const QString & text, QWidget * parent = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0
  )

   Constructs a label that displays the text, text.

   The parent and widget flag f, arguments are passed to the QFrame
   constructor.

   See also setText(), setAlignment(), setFrameStyle(), and setIndent().

  QLabel::~QLabel ()

   Destroys the label.

  QWidget * QLabel::buddy () const

   Returns this label's buddy, or 0 if no buddy is currently set.

   See also setBuddy().

  void QLabel::clear ()   [slot]

   Clears any label contents.

  QMovie * QLabel::movie () const

   Returns a pointer to the label's movie, or 0 if no movie has been set.

   See also setMovie().

  const QPicture * QLabel::picture () const

   Returns the label's picture or 0 if the label doesn't have a picture.

  void QLabel::setBuddy ( QWidget * buddy )

   Sets this label's buddy to buddy.

   When the user presses the shortcut key indicated by this label, the
   keyboard focus is transferred to the label's buddy widget.

   The buddy mechanism is only available for QLabels that contain plain
   text in which one letter is prefixed with an ampersand, &. This letter
   is set as the shortcut key. The letter is displayed underlined, and
   the '&' is not displayed (i.e. the Qt::TextShowMnemonic alignment flag
   is turned on; see setAlignment()).

   In a dialog, you might create two data entry widgets and a label for
   each, and set up the geometry layout so each label is just to the left
   of its data entry widget (its "buddy"), for example:
    QLineEdit *nameEd  = new QLineEdit(this);
    QLabel    *nameLb  = new QLabel("&Name:", this);
    nameLb->setBuddy(nameEd);
    QLineEdit *phoneEd = new QLineEdit(this);
    QLabel    *phoneLb = new QLabel("&Phone:", this);
    phoneLb->setBuddy(phoneEd);
    // (layout setup not shown)

   With the code above, the focus jumps to the Name field when the user
   presses Alt+N, and to the Phone field when the user presses Alt+P.

   To unset a previously set buddy, call this function with buddy set to
   0.

   See also buddy(), setText(), QShortcut, and setAlignment().

  void QLabel::setMovie ( QMovie * movie )   [slot]

   Sets the label contents to movie. Any previous content is cleared.

   The buddy shortcut, if any, is disabled.

   The label resizes itself if auto-resizing is enabled.

   See also movie() and setBuddy().

  void QLabel::setNum ( int num )   [slot]

   Sets the label contents to plain text containing the textual
   representation of integer num. Any previous content is cleared. Does
   nothing if the integer's string representation is the same as the
   current contents of the label.

   The buddy shortcut, if any, is disabled.

   The label resizes itself if auto-resizing is enabled.

   See also setText(), QString::setNum(), and setBuddy().

  void QLabel::setNum ( double num )   [slot]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the label contents to plain text containing the textual
   representation of double num. Any previous content is cleared. Does
   nothing if the double's string representation is the same as the
   current contents of the label.

   The buddy shortcut, if any, is disabled.

   The label resizes itself if auto-resizing is enabled.

   See also setText(), QString::setNum(), and setBuddy().

  void QLabel::setPicture ( const QPicture & picture )   [slot]

   Sets the label contents to picture. Any previous content is cleared.

   The buddy shortcut, if any, is disabled.

   See also picture() and setBuddy().
