Detailed Description

   The QLinkedList class is a template class that provides linked lists.

   QLinkedList<T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It stores a
   list of values and provides iterator-based access as well as constant
   time insertions and removals.

   QList<T>, QLinkedList<T>, and QVector<T> provide similar
   functionality. Here's an overview:
     * For most purposes, QList is the right class to use. Its
       index-based API is more convenient than QLinkedList's
       iterator-based API, and it is usually faster than QVector because
       of the way it stores its items in memory. It also expands to less
       code in your executable.
     * If you need a real linked list, with guarantees of constant time
       insertions in the middle of the list and iterators to items rather
       than indexes, use QLinkedList.
     * If you want the items to occupy adjacent memory positions, use
       QVector.

   Here's an example of a QLinkedList that stores integers and a
   QLinkedList that stores QTime values:
    QLinkedList<int> integerList;
    QLinkedList<QTime> timeList;

   QLinkedList stores a list of items. The default constructor creates an
   empty list. To insert items into the list, you can use operator<<():
    QLinkedList<QString> list;
    list << "one" << "two" << "three";
    // list: ["one", "two", "three"]

   If you want to get the first or last item in a linked list, use
   first() or last(). If you want to remove an item from either end of
   the list, use removeFirst() or removeLast(). If you want to remove all
   occurrences of a given value in the list, use removeAll().

   A common requirement is to remove the first or last item in the list
   and do something with it. For this, QLinkedList provides takeFirst()
   and takeLast(). Here's a loop that removes the items from a list one
   at a time and calls delete on them:
    QLinkedList<QWidget *> list;
    ...
    while (!list.isEmpty())
        delete list.takeFirst();

   QLinkedList's value type must be an assignable data type. This covers
   most data types that are commonly used, but the compiler won't let
   you, for example, store a QWidget as a value; instead, store a QWidget
   *. A few functions have additional requirements; for example,
   contains() and removeAll() expect the value type to support
   operator==(). These requirements are documented on a per-function
   basis.

   If you want to insert, modify, or remove items in the middle of the
   list, you must use an iterator. QLinkedList provides both Java-style
   iterators (QLinkedListIterator and QMutableLinkedListIterator) and
   STL-style iterators (QLinkedList::const_iterator and
   QLinkedList::iterator). See the documentation for these classes for
   details.

   See also QListIterator, QMutableListIterator, QList, and QVector.

Member Function Documentation

  QLinkedList::QLinkedList ()

   Constructs an empty list.

  QLinkedList::QLinkedList ( const QLinkedList & other )

   Constructs a copy of other.

   This operation occurs in constant time, because QLinkedList is
   implicitly shared. This makes returning a QLinkedList from a function
   very fast. If a shared instance is modified, it will be copied
   (copy-on-write), and this takes linear time.

   See also operator=().

  QLinkedList::~QLinkedList ()

   Destroys the list. References to the values in the list, and all
   iterators over this list, become invalid.

  void QLinkedList::append ( const T & value )

   Inserts value at the end of the list.

   Example:
    QLinkedList<QString> list;
    list.append("one");
    list.append("two");
    list.append("three");
    // list: ["one", "two", "three"]

   This is the same as list.insert(end(), value).

   See also operator<<(), prepend(), and insert().

  T & QLinkedList::back ()

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   last().

  const T & QLinkedList::back () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   returns false.

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

    list.prepend("one");
    list.prepend("two");
    list.prepend("three");
    // list: ["three", "two", "one"]

   This is the same as list.insert(begin(), value).

   See also append() and insert().

  void QLinkedList::push_back ( const T & value )

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   append(value).

  void QLinkedList::push_front ( const T & value )

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   prepend(value).
