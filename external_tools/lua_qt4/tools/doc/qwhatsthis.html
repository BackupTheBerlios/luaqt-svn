Detailed Description

   The QWhatsThis class provides a simple description of any widget, i.e.
   answering the question "What's This?".

   "What's This?" help is part of an application's online help system,
   and provides users with information about the functionality and usage
   of a particular widget. "What's This?" help texts are typically longer
   and more detailed than tooltips, but generally provide less
   information than that supplied by separate help windows.

   QWhatsThis provides a single window with an explanatory text that pops
   up when the user asks "What's This?". The default way for users to ask
   the question is to move the focus to the relevant widget and press
   Shift+F1. The help text appears immediately; it goes away as soon as
   the user does something else. (Note that if there is a shortcut for
   Shift+F1, this mechanism will not work.) Some dialogs provide a "?"
   button that users can click to enter "What's This?" mode; they then
   click the relevant widget to pop up the "What's This?" window. It is
   also possible to provide a a menu option or toolbar button to switch
   into "What's This?" mode.

   To add "What's This?" text to a widget or an action, you simply call
   QWidget::setWhatsThis() or QAction::setWhatsThis().

   The text can be either rich text or plain text. If you specify a rich
   text formatted string, it will be rendered using the default
   stylesheet, making it possible to embed images in the displayed text.
   To be as fast as possible, the default stylesheet uses a simple method
   to determine whether the text can be rendered as plain text. See
   Qt::mightBeRichText() for details.
        newAct = new QAction(tr("&New"), this);
        newAct->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+N"));
        newAct->setStatusTip(tr("Create a new file"));
        newAct->setWhatsThis(tr("Click this option to create a new file."));

   An alternative way to enter "What's This?" mode is to call
   createAction(), and add the returned QAction to either a menu or a
   tool bar. By invoking this context help action (in the picture below,
   the button with the arrow and question mark icon) the user switches
   into "What's This?" mode. If they now click on a widget the
   appropriate help text is shown. The mode is left when help is given or
   when the user presses Esc.

                              [whatsthis.png]

   You can enter "What's This?" mode programmatically with
   enterWhatsThisMode(), check the mode with inWhatsThisMode(), and
   return to normal mode with leaveWhatsThisMode().

   If you want to control the "What's This?" behavior of a widget
   manually see Qt::WA_CustomWhatsThis.

   It is also possible to show different help texts for different regions
   of a widget, by using a QHelpEvent of type QEvent::WhatsThis.
   Intercept the help event in your widget's QWidget::event() function
   and call QWhatsThis::showText() with the text you want to display for
   the position specified in QHelpEvent::pos(). If the text is rich text
   and the user clicks on a link, the widget also receives a
   QWhatsThisClickedEvent with the link's reference as
   QWhatsThisClickedEvent::href(). If a QWhatsThisClickedEvent is handled
   (i.e. QWidget::event() returns true), the help window remains visible.
   Call QWhatsThis::hideText() to hide it explicitly.

   See also QToolTip.

Member Function Documentation

  QAction * QWhatsThis::createAction ( QObject * parent = 0 )   [static]

   Returns a ready-made QAction, used to invoke "What's This?" context
   help, with the given parent.

   The returned QAction provides a convenient way to let users enter
   "What's This?" mode.

  void QWhatsThis::enterWhatsThisMode ()   [static]

   This function switches the user interface into "What's This?" mode.
   The user interface can be switched back into normal mode by the user
   (e.g. by them clicking or pressing Esc), or programmatically by
   calling leaveWhatsThisMode().

   When entering "What's This?" mode, a QEvent of type
   Qt::EnterWhatsThisMode is sent to all toplevel widgets.

   See also inWhatsThisMode() and leaveWhatsThisMode().

  void QWhatsThis::hideText ()   [static]

   If a "What's This?" window is showing, this destroys it.

   See also showText().

  bool QWhatsThis::inWhatsThisMode ()   [static]

   Returns true if the user interface is in "What's This?" mode;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also enterWhatsThisMode().

  void QWhatsThis::leaveWhatsThisMode ()   [static]

   If the user interface is in "What's This?" mode, this function
   switches back to normal mode; otherwise it does nothing.

   When leaving "What's This?" mode, a QEvent of type
   Qt::LeaveWhatsThisMode is sent to all toplevel widgets.

   See also enterWhatsThisMode() and inWhatsThisMode().

  void QWhatsThis::showText ( const QPoint & pos, const QString & text, QWidget
  * w = 0 )   [static]

   Shows text as a "What's This?" window, at global position pos. The
   optional widget argument, w, is used to determine the appropriate
   screen on multi-head systems.

   See also hideText().
