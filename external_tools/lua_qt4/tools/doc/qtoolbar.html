Detailed Description

   The QToolBar class provides a movable panel that contains a set of
   controls.

   Toolbar buttons are added by adding actions, using addAction() or
   insertAction(). Groups of buttons can be separated using
   addSeparator() or insertSeparator(). If a toolbar button is not
   appropriate, a widget can be inserted instead using addWidget() or
   insertWidget(); examples of suitable widgets are QSpinBox,
   QDoubleSpinBox, and QComboBox. When a toolbar button is pressed it
   emits the actionTriggered() signal. Toolbars may only be added to
   QMainWindow and QMainWindow subclasses.

   A toolbar can be fixed in place in a particular area (e.g. at the top
   of the window), or it can be movable (isMovable()) between toolbar
   areas; see allowedAreas() and isAreaAllowed().

   See also QToolButton.

Property Documentation

  allowedAreas : Qt::ToolBarAreas

   This property holds areas where the toolbar may be placed.

   The default is Qt::AllToolBarAreas.

   This property only makes sense if the toolbar is in a QMainWindow.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::ToolBarAreas allowedAreas () const
     * void setAllowedAreas ( Qt::ToolBarAreas areas )

   See also movable.

  iconSize : QSize

   This property holds size of icons in the toolbar.

   The default is Qt::AutomaticIconSize.

   Access functions:
     * QSize iconSize () const
     * void setIconSize ( const QSize & iconSize )

  movable : bool

   This property holds whether the user can move the toolbar within the
   toolbar area, or between toolbar areas.

   By default, this property is true.

   This property only makes sense if the toolbar is in a QMainWindow.

   Access functions:
     * bool isMovable () const
     * void setMovable ( bool movable )

   See also allowedAreas.

  orientation : Qt::Orientation

   This property holds orientation of the toolbar.

   The default is Qt::Horizontal.

   The orientation is updated automatically when the toolbar is managed
   by QMainWindow.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::Orientation orientation () const
     * void setOrientation ( Qt::Orientation orientation )

  toolButtonStyle : Qt::ToolButtonStyle

   This property holds style of toolbar buttons.

   The defaults is Qt::ToolButtonIconOnly.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::ToolButtonStyle toolButtonStyle () const
     * void setToolButtonStyle ( Qt::ToolButtonStyle toolButtonStyle )

Member Function Documentation

  QToolBar::QToolBar ( const QString & title, QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QToolBar with the given parent.

   The window title is set to title. This title is used when the toolbar
   is floating as an independent window. It is also shown in the context
   menu provided by QMainWindow.

   See also setWindowTitle().

  QToolBar::QToolBar ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QToolBar with the given parent.

  QToolBar::~QToolBar ()

   Destroys the toolbar.

  QAction * QToolBar::actionAt ( const QPoint & p ) const

   Returns the action at point p. This function returns zero if no action
   was found.

   See also QWidget::childAt().

  QAction * QToolBar::actionAt ( int x, int y ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the action at the point x, y. This function returns zero if no
   action was found.

  void QToolBar::actionTriggered ( QAction * action )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when a toolbar button is pressed. The parameter
   holds the toolbar button's associated action.

  QAction * QToolBar::addAction ( const QString & text )

   Creates a new action with the given text. This action is added to the
   end of the toolbar.

  QAction * QToolBar::addAction ( const QIcon & icon, const QString & text )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Creates a new action with the given icon and text. This action is
   added to the end of the toolbar.

  QAction * QToolBar::addAction ( const QString & text, const QObject *
  receiver, const char * member )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Creates a new action with the given text. This action is added to the
   end of the toolbar. The action's triggered() signal is connected to
   member in receiver.

  QAction * QToolBar::addAction ( const QIcon & icon, const QString & text,
  const QObject * receiver, const char * member )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Creates a new action with the icon icon and text text. This action is
   added to the end of the toolbar. The action's triggered() signal is
   connected to member in receiver.

  QAction * QToolBar::addSeparator ()

   Adds a separator to the end of the toolbar.

   See also insertSeparator().

  QAction * QToolBar::addWidget ( QWidget * widget )

   Adds the given widget to the toolbar as the toolbar's last item.

   See also insertWidget().

  void QToolBar::allowedAreasChanged ( Qt::ToolBarAreas allowedAreas )
  [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the collection of allowed areas for the
   toolbar is changed. The new areas in which the toolbar can be
   positioned are specified by allowedAreas.

   See also allowedAreas.

  void QToolBar::clear ()

   Removes all actions from the toolbar.

   See also removeAction().

  void QToolBar::iconSizeChanged ( const QSize & iconSize )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the icon size is changed. The iconSize
   parameter holds the toolbar's new icon size.

   See also iconSize and QMainWindow::iconSize.

  QAction * QToolBar::insertSeparator ( QAction * before )

   Inserts a separator into the toolbar in front of the toolbar item
   associated with the before action.

   See also addSeparator().

  QAction * QToolBar::insertWidget ( QAction * before, QWidget * widget )

   Inserts the given widget in front of the toolbar item associated with
   the before action.

   See also addWidget().

  bool QToolBar::isAreaAllowed ( Qt::ToolBarArea area ) const

   Returns true if this toolbar is dockable in the given area; otherwise
   returns false.

  void QToolBar::movableChanged ( bool movable )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the toolbar becomes movable or fixed. If
   the toolbar can be moved, movable is true; otherwise it is false.

   See also movable.

  void QToolBar::orientationChanged ( Qt::Orientation orientation )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the orientation of the toolbar changes.
   The new orientation is specified by the orientation given.

   See also orientation.

  QAction * QToolBar::toggleViewAction () const

   Returns a checkable action that can be used to show or hide this
   toolbar.

   The action's text is set to the toolbar's window title.

   See also QAction::text and QWidget::windowTitle.

  void QToolBar::toolButtonStyleChanged ( Qt::ToolButtonStyle toolButtonStyle
  )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the tool button style is changed. The
   toolButtonStyle parameter holds the toolbar's new tool button style.

   See also toolButtonStyle and QMainWindow::toolButtonStyle.
