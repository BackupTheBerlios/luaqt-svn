Detailed Description

   The QListView class provides a list or icon view onto a model.

   A QListView presents items stored in a model, either as a simple
   non-hierarchical list, or as a collection of icons. This class is used
   to provide lists and icon views that were previously provided by the
   QListBox and QIconView classes, but using the more flexible approach
   provided by Qt's model/view architecture.

   The QListView class is one of the Model/View Classes and is part of
   Qt's model/view framework.

   This view does not display horizontal or vertical headers; to display
   a list of items with a horizontal header, use QTreeView instead.

   QListView implements the interfaces defined by the QAbstractItemView
   class to allow it to display data provided by models derived from the
   QAbstractItemModel class.

   Items in a list view can be displayed using one of two view modes: In
   ListMode, the items are displayed in the form of a simple list; in
   IconMode, the list view takes the form of an icon view in which the
   items are displayed with icons like files in a file manager. By
   default, the list view is in ListMode. To change the view mode, use
   the setViewMode() function, and to determine the current view mode,
   use viewMode().

   Items in these views are laid out in the direction specified by the
   flow() of the list view. The items may be fixed in place, or allowed
   to move, depending on the view's movement() state.

   If the items in the model cannot be completely laid out in the
   direction of flow, they can be wrapped at the boundary of the view
   widget; this depends on isWrapping(). This property is useful when the
   items are being represented by an icon view.

   The resizeMode() and layoutMode() govern how and when the items are
   laid out. Items are spaced according to their spacing(), and can exist
   within a notional grid of size specified by gridSize(). The items can
   be rendered as large or small icons depending on their iconSize().

   See also Model/View Programming.

   QListView::Snap 2 The items snap to the specified grid when moved; see
   setGridSize().

  enum QListView::ResizeMode

   Constant Value Description
   QListView::Fixed 0 The items will only be laid out the first time the
   view is shown.
   QListView::Adjust 1 The items will be laid out every time the view is
   resized.

  enum QListView::ViewMode

   Constant Value Description
   QListView::ListMode 0 The items are layed out using TopToBottom flow,
   with Small size and Static movement
   QListView::IconMode 1 The items are layed out using LeftToRight flow,
   with Large size and Free movement

Property Documentation

  flow : Flow

   This property holds which direction the items layout should flow.

   If this property is LeftToRight, the items will be laid out left to
   right. If the isWrapping property is true, the layout will wrap when
   it reaches the right side of the visible area. If this property is
   TopToBottom, the items will be laid out from the top of the visible
   area, wrapping when it reaches the bottom.

   Setting this property when the view is visible will cause the items to
   be laid out again.

   Access functions:
     * Flow flow () const
     * void setFlow ( Flow flow )

  gridSize : QSize

   This property holds the size of the layout grid.

   This property is the size of the grid in which the items are laid out.
   The default is an empty size which means that there is no grid and the
   layout is not done in a grid. Setting this property to a non-empty
   size switches on the grid layout. (When a grid layout is in force the
   spacing property is ignored.)

   Setting this property when the view is visible will cause the items to
   be laid out again.

   Access functions:
     * QSize gridSize () const
     * void setGridSize ( const QSize & size )

  isWrapping : bool

   This property holds whether the items layout should wrap.

   This property holds whether the layout should wrap when there is no
   more space in the visible area. The point at which the layout wraps
   depends on the flow property.

   Setting this property when the view is visible will cause the items to
   be laid out again.

   Access functions:
     * bool isWrapping () const
     * void setWrapping ( bool enable )

  layoutMode : LayoutMode

   This property holds whether the layout of items should happen
   immediately or be delayed.

   This property holds the layout mode for the items. When the mode is
   Instant (the default), the items are laid out all in one go. When the
   mode is Batched, the items are laid out in batches of 100 items, while
   processing events. This makes it possible to instantly view and
   interact with the visible items while the rest are being laid out.

   Access functions:
     * LayoutMode layoutMode () const
     * void setLayoutMode ( LayoutMode mode )

  modelColumn : int

   This property holds the column in the model that is visible.

   Access functions:
     * int modelColumn () const
     * void setModelColumn ( int column )

  movement : Movement

   This property holds whether the items can be moved freely, are snapped
   to a grid, or cannot be moved at all.

   This property determines how the user can move the items in the view.
   Static means that the items can't be moved the user. Free means that
   the user can drag and drop the items to any position in the view. Snap
   means that the user can drag and drop the items, but only to the
   positions in a notional grid signified by the gridSize property.

   Setting this property when the view is visible will cause the items to
   be laid out again.

   Access functions:
     * Movement movement () const
     * void setMovement ( Movement movement )

   See also gridSize.

  resizeMode : ResizeMode

   This property holds whether the items are laid out again when the view
   is resized.

   If this property is Adjust, the items will be laid out again when the
   view is resized. If the value is Fixed, the items will not be laid out
   when the view is resized.

   Access functions:
     * ResizeMode resizeMode () const
     * void setResizeMode ( ResizeMode mode )

  spacing : int

   This property holds the space between items in the layout.

   This property is the size of the empty space between items in the
   layout. This property is ignored if the items are laid out in a grid.

   Setting this property when the view is visible will cause the items to
   be laid out again.

   Access functions:
     * int spacing () const
     * void setSpacing ( int space )

  viewMode : ViewMode

   This property holds the view mode of the QListView.

   This property will change the other unset properties to conform with
   the set view mode. Properties that have already been set will not be
   changed, unless clearPropertyFlags() has been called.

   Access functions:
     * ViewMode viewMode () const
     * void setViewMode ( ViewMode mode )
