Detailed Description

   The QMenuBar class provides a horizontal menu bar.

   A menu bar consists of a list of pull-down menu items. You add menu
   items with addMenu(). For example, asuming that menubar is a pointer
   to a QMenuBar and fileMenu is a pointer to a QMenu, the following
   statement inserts the menu into the menu bar:
    menubar->addMenu(fileMenu);

   The ampersand in the menu item's text sets Alt+F as a shortcut for
   this menu. (You can use "&&" to get a real ampersand in the menu bar.)

   There is no need to lay out a menu bar. It automatically sets its own
   geometry to the top of the parent widget and changes it appropriately
   whenever the parent is resized.

   In most main window style applications you would use the menuBar()
   provided in QMainWindow, adding QMenus to the menu bar and adding
   QActions to the popup menus.

   Example (from the Menus example):
        fileMenu = menuBar()->addMenu(tr("&File"));
        fileMenu->addAction(newAct);

   Menu items may be removed with removeAction().

  QMenuBar on Qt/Mac

   QMenuBar on Qt/Mac is a wrapper for using the system-wide menubar. If
   you have multiple menubars in one dialog the outermost menubar
   (normally inside a widget with widget flag Qt::Window) will be used
   for the system-wide menubar.

   Qt/Mac also provides a menubar merging feature to make QMenuBar
   conform more closely to accepted Mac OS X menubar layout. The merging
   functionality is based on string matching the title of a QMenu entry.
   These strings are translated (using QObject::tr()) in the "QMenuBar"
   context. If an entry is moved its slots will still fire as if it was
   in the original place. The table below outlines the strings looked for
   and where the entry is placed if matched:

                       String matches Placement Notes
    about.* Application Menu | About <application name> If this entry is
        not found no About item will appear in the Application Menu
     config, options, setup, settings or preferences Application Menu |
      Preferences If this entry is not found the Settings item will be
                                  disabled
   quit or exit Application Menu | Quit <application name> If this entry
          is not found a default Quit item will be created to call
                            QApplication::quit()

   The Menus example shows how to use QMenuBar and QMenu.

Property Documentation

  defaultUp : bool

   This property holds the popup orientation.

   The default popup orientation. By default, menus pop "down" the
   screen. By setting the property to true, the menu will pop "up". You
   might call this for menus that are below the document to which they
   refer.

   If the menu would not fit on the screen, the other direction is used
   automatically.

   Access functions:
     * bool isDefaultUp () const
     * void setDefaultUp ( bool )

Member Function Documentation

  QMenuBar::QMenuBar ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a menu bar with parent parent.

  QMenuBar::~QMenuBar ()

   Destroys the menu bar.

  QAction * QMenuBar::activeAction () const

   Returns the QAction that is currently highlighted. A null pointer will
   be returned if no action is currently selected.

  QAction * QMenuBar::addAction ( const QString & text )

   This convenience function creates a new action with text. The function
   adds the newly created action to the menu's list of actions, and
   returns it.

   See also QWidget::addAction().

  QAction * QMenuBar::addAction ( const QString & text, const QObject *
  receiver, const char * member )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This convenience function creates a new action with the given text.
   The action's triggered() signal is connected to the receiver's member
   slot. The function adds the newly created action to the menu's list of
   actions and returns it.

   See also QWidget::addAction().

  QAction * QMenuBar::addMenu ( QMenu * menu )

   Appends menu to the menubar. Returns the menu's menuAction().

   See also QWidget::addAction() and QMenu::menuAction().

  QMenu * QMenuBar::addMenu ( const QString & title )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Appends a new QMenu with title to the menubar. The menubar takes
   ownership of the menu. Returns the new menu.

   See also QWidget::addAction() and QMenu::menuAction().

  QMenu * QMenuBar::addMenu ( const QIcon & icon, const QString & title )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Appends a new QMenu with icon and title to the menubar. The menubar
   takes ownership of the menu. Returns the new menu.

   See also QWidget::addAction() and QMenu::menuAction().

  QAction * QMenuBar::addSeparator ()

   Appends a separator to the menu.

  void QMenuBar::clear ()

   Removes all the actions from the menu bar.

   See also removeAction().

  void QMenuBar::hovered ( QAction * action )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when a menu action is highlighted; action is
   the action that caused the event to be sent.

   Often this is used to update status information.

   See also triggered() and QAction::hovered().

  QAction * QMenuBar::insertMenu ( QAction * before, QMenu * menu )

   This convenience function inserts menu before action before and
   returns the menus menuAction().

   See also QWidget::insertAction() and addMenu().

  void QMenuBar::triggered ( QAction * action )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when a menu action is selected; action is the
   action that caused the event to be sent.

   Normally, you connect each menu action to a single slot using
   QAction::triggered(), but sometimes you will want to connect several
   items to a single slot (most often if the user selects from an array).
   This signal is useful in such cases.

   See also hovered() and QAction::triggered().
