Detailed Description

   The QGroupBox widget provides a group box frame with a title.

   A group box provides a frame, a title and a keyboard shortcut, and
   displays various other widgets inside itself. The title is on top, the
   keyboard shortcut moves keyboard focus to one of the group box's child
   widgets.

   QGroupBox also lets you set the title (normally set in the
   constructor) and the title's alignment(). If setCheckable(true) is
   called then the group box is isCheckable(), and it can be
   setChecked(). Checkable group boxes child widgets are enabled or
   disabled depending on whether or not the group box is isChecked().

   To minimize space consumption, you can remove the right, left and
   bottom edges of the frame with setFlat().

Property Documentation

  alignment : Qt::Alignment

   This property holds the alignment of the group box title.

   The title is always placed on the upper frame line. The horizontal
   alignment can be specified by the alignment parameter.

   The alignment is one of the following flags:
     * Qt::AlignLeft aligns the title text to the left.
     * Qt::AlignRight aligns the title text to the right.
     * Qt::AlignHCenter aligns the title text centered.

   The default alignment is Qt::AlignLeft.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::Alignment alignment () const
     * void setAlignment ( int )

   See also Qt::Alignment.

  checkable : bool

   This property holds whether the group box has a checkbox in its title.

   If this property is true, the group box has a checkbox. If the
   checkbox is checked (which is the default), the group box's children
   are enabled.

   setCheckable() controls whether or not the group box has a checkbox,
   and isCheckable() controls whether the checkbox is checked or not.

   Access functions:
     * bool isCheckable () const
     * void setCheckable ( bool b )

  checked : bool

   This property holds whether the group box's checkbox is checked.

   If the group box has a check box (see isCheckable()), and the check
   box is checked, the group box's children are enabled. If the checkbox
   is unchecked the children are disabled.

   Access functions:
     * bool isChecked () const
     * void setChecked ( bool b )

  flat : bool

   This property holds whether the group box is painted flat or has a
   frame.

   By default a group box has a surrounding frame, with the title being
   placed on the upper frame line. In flat mode the right, left and
   bottom frame lines are omitted, and only the thin line at the top is
   drawn.

   Access functions:
     * bool isFlat () const
     * void setFlat ( bool b )

   See also title.

  title : QString

   This property holds the group box title text.

   The group box title text will have a focus-change keyboard shortcut if
   the title contains &, followed by a letter.
    g->setTitle("&User information");

   This produces "User information"; Alt+U moves the keyboard focus to
   the group box.

   There is no default title text.

   Access functions:
     * QString title () const
     * void setTitle ( const QString & )

Member Function Documentation

  QGroupBox::QGroupBox ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a group box widget with no title and parent parent.

  QGroupBox::QGroupBox ( const QString & title, QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a group box with the title title and parent parent.

  QGroupBox::~QGroupBox ()

   Destroys the group box.

  void QGroupBox::toggled ( bool on )   [signal]

   If the group box has a check box (see isCheckable()) this signal is
   emitted when the check box is toggled. on is true if the check box is
   checked; otherwise it is false.
