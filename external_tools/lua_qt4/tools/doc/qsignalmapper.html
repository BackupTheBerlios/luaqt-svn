Detailed Description

   The QSignalMapper class bundles signals from identifiable senders.

   This class collects a set of parameterless signals, and re-emits them
   with integer, string or widget parameters corresponding to the object
   that sent the signal.

   The class supports the mapping of particular strings or integers with
   particular objects using setMapping(). The objects' signals can then
   be connected to the map() slot which will emit the mapped() signal
   with the string or integer associated with the original signalling
   object. Mappings can be removed later using removeMappings().

   Example: Suppose we want to create a custom widget that contains a
   group of buttons (like a tool palette). One approach is to connect
   each button's clicked() signal to its own custom slot; but in this
   example we want to connect all the buttons to a single slot and
   parameterize the slot by the button that was clicked.

   Here's the definition of a simple custom widget that has a single
   signal, clicked(), which is emitted with the text of the button that
   was clicked:
    class ButtonWidget : public QWidget
    {
        Q_OBJECT

    public:
        ButtonWidget(QStringList texts, QWidget *parent = 0);

    signals:
        void clicked(const QString &text);

    private:
        QSignalMapper *signalMapper;
    };

   The only function that we need to implement is the constructor:
    ButtonWidget::ButtonWidget(QStringList texts, QWidget *parent)
        : QWidget(parent)
    {
        signalMapper = new QSignalMapper(this);

        QGridLayout *gridLayout = new QGridLayout;
        for (int i = 0; i < texts.size(); ++i) {
            QPushButton *button = new QPushButton(texts[i]);
            connect(button, SIGNAL(clicked()), signalMapper, SLOT(map()));
            signalMapper->setMapping(button, texts[i]);
            gridLayout->addWidget(button, i / 3, i % 3);
        }

        connect(signalMapper, SIGNAL(mapped(const QString &)),
                this, SIGNAL(clicked(const QString &)));

        setLayout(gridLayout);
    }

   A list of texts is passed to the constructor. A signal mapper is
   constructed and for each text in the list a QPushButton is created. We
   connect each button's clicked() signal to the signal mapper's map()
   slot, and create a mapping in the signal mapper from each button to
   the button's text. Finally we connect the signal mapper's mapped()
   signal to the custom widget's clicked() signal. When the user clicks a
   button, the custom widget will emit a single clicked() signal whose
   argument is the text of the button the user clicked.

Member Function Documentation

  QSignalMapper::QSignalMapper ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QSignalMapper with parent parent.

  QSignalMapper::~QSignalMapper ()

   Destroys the QSignalMapper.

  void QSignalMapper::map ()   [slot]

   This slot emits signals based on which object sends signals to it.

  void QSignalMapper::map ( QObject * sender )   [slot]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This slot emits signals based on the sender object.

  void QSignalMapper::mapped ( int i )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when map() is signalled from an object that has
   an integer mapping set. The object's mapped integer is passed in i.

   See also setMapping().

  void QSignalMapper::mapped ( const QString & text )   [signal]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This signal is emitted when map() is signalled from an object that has
   a string mapping set. The object's mapped string is passed in text.

   See also setMapping().

  void QSignalMapper::mapped ( QWidget * widget )   [signal]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This signal is emitted when map() is signalled from an object that has
   a widget mapping set. The object's mapped widget is passed in widget.

   See also setMapping().

  QObject * QSignalMapper::mapping ( int id ) const

   Returns the sender QObject that is associated with the given id.

   See also setMapping().

  QObject * QSignalMapper::mapping ( const QString & id ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  QObject * QSignalMapper::mapping ( QWidget * widget ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the sender QObject that is associated with the given widget.

  void QSignalMapper::removeMappings ( QObject * sender )

   Removes all mappings for sender.

   This is done automatically when mapped objects are destroyed.

  void QSignalMapper::setMapping ( QObject * sender, int id )

   Adds a mapping so that when map() is signalled from the given sender,
   the signal mapped(id) is emitted.

   There may be at most one integer ID for each object.

   See also mapping().

  void QSignalMapper::setMapping ( QObject * sender, const QString & text )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Adds a mapping so that when map() is signalled from the given sender,
   the signal mapped(text ) is emitted.

   There may be at most one text for each object.

  void QSignalMapper::setMapping ( QObject * sender, QWidget * widget )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Adds a mapping so that when map() is signalled from the given sender,
   the signal mapped(widget ) is emitted.

   There may be at most one widget for each object.
