Detailed Description

   The QAction class provides an abstract user interface action that can
   be inserted into widgets.

   In applications many common commands can be invoked via menus, toolbar
   buttons, and keyboard shortcuts. Since the user expects each command
   to be performed in the same way, regardless of the user interface
   used, it is useful to represent each command as an action.

   Actions can be added to menus and toolbars, and will automatically
   keep them in sync. For example, in a word processor, if the user
   presses a Bold toolbar button, the Bold menu item will automatically
   be checked.

   Actions can be created as independent objects, but they may also be
   created during the construction of menus; the QMenu class contains
   convenience functions for creating actions suitable for use as menu
   items.

   A QAction may contain an icon, menu text, a shortcut, status text,
   "What's This?" text, and a tool tip. Most of these can be set in the
   constructor. They can also be set independently with setIcon(),
   setText(), setIconText(), setShortcut(), setStatusTip(),
   setWhatsThis(), and setToolTip(). For menu items, it is possible to
   set an individual font with setFont().

   Actions are added to widgets using QWidget::addAction().

   Once a QAction has been created it should be added to the relevant
   menu and toolbar, then connected to the slot which will perform the
   action. For example:
        openAct = new QAction(QIcon(":/images/open.png"), tr("&Open..."), this)
;
        openAct->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+O"));
        openAct->setStatusTip(tr("Open an existing file"));
        connect(openAct, SIGNAL(triggered()), this, SLOT(open()));

        fileMenu->addAction(openAct);
        fileToolBar->addAction(openAct);

   We recommend that actions are created as children of the window they
   are used in. In most cases actions will be children of the
   application's main window.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QAction::ActionEvent

   This enum type is used when calling QAction::activate()

   Constant Value Description
   QAction::Trigger 0 this will cause the QAction::triggered() signal to
   be emitted.
   QAction::Hover 1 this will cause the QAction::hovered() signal to be
   emitted.
     _________________________________________________________________

Property Documentation

  checkable : bool

   This property holds whether the action is a checkable action.

   A checkable action is one which has an on/off state. For example, in a
   word processor, a Bold toolbar button may be either on or off. An
   action which is not a toggle action is a command action; a command
   action is simply executed, e.g. file save. By default, this property
   is false.

   In some situations, the state of one toggle action should depend on
   the state of others. For example, "Left Align", "Center" and "Right
   Align" toggle actions are mutually exclusive. To achieve exclusive
   toggling, add the relevant toggle actions to a QActionGroup with the
   QActionGroup::exclusive property set to true.

   Access functions:
     * bool isCheckable () const
     * void setCheckable ( bool )

   See also QAction::setChecked().

  checked : bool

   This property holds whether the action is checked.

   Only checkable actions can be checked. By default, this is false (the
   action is unchecked).

   Access functions:
     * bool isChecked () const
     * void setChecked ( bool )

   See also checkable.

  enabled : bool

   This property holds whether the action is enabled.

   Disabled actions cannot be chosen by the user. They do not disappear
   from menus or toolbars, but they are displayed in a way which
   indicates that they are unavailable. For example, they might be
   displayed using only shades of gray.

   What's this? help on disabled actions is still available, provided
   that the QAction::whatsThis property is set.

   Access functions:
     * bool isEnabled () const
     * void setEnabled ( bool )

  font : QFont

   This property holds the action's font.

   The font property is used to render the text set on the QAction. The
   font will can be considered a hint as it will not be consulted in all
   cases based upon application and style.

   Access functions:
     * QFont font () const
     * void setFont ( const QFont & font )

   See also QAction::setText() and QStyle.

  icon : QIcon

   This property holds the action's icon.

   In toolbars, the icon is used as the tool button icon; in menus, it is
   displayed to the left of the menu text. There is no default icon.

   If a null icon (QIcon::isNull() is passed into this function, the icon
   of the action is cleared.

   Access functions:
     * QIcon icon () const
     * void setIcon ( const QIcon & icon )

  iconText : QString

   This property holds the action's descriptive icon text.

   If QMainWindow::usesTextLabel is true, the text appears as a label in
   the relevant tool button. It also serves as the default text in menus
   and tool tips if these have not been specifically defined with
   setText() or setToolTip(). If the icon text is not explicitly set in
   the by using setIconText(), the action's normal text will be used as
   icon text. There is no default icon text.

   Access functions:
     * QString iconText () const
     * void setIconText ( const QString & text )

   See also setToolTip() and setStatusTip().

  shortcut : QKeySequence

   This property holds the action's shortcut key.

   Valid keycodes for this property can be found in Qt::Key and
   Qt::Modifier. There is no default shortcut key.

   Access functions:
     * QKeySequence shortcut () const
     * void setShortcut ( const QKeySequence & shortcut )

  shortcutContext : Qt::ShortcutContext

   This property holds the context for the action's shortcut.

   Valid values for this property can be found in Qt::ShortcutContext.
   The default value is Qt::WindowShortcut.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::ShortcutContext shortcutContext () const
     * void setShortcutContext ( Qt::ShortcutContext context )

  statusTip : QString

   This property holds the action's status tip.

   The statusTip is displayed on all status bars provided by the action's
   top-level parent widget.

   There is no default statusTip text.

   Access functions:
     * QString statusTip () const
     * void setStatusTip ( const QString & statusTip )

   See also setToolTip() and showStatusText().

  text : QString

   This property holds the action's descriptive text.

   If the action is added to a menu, the menu option will consist of the
   icon (if there is one), the text, and the shortcut (if there is one).
   If the text is not explicitly set in the constructor, or by using
   setText(), the action's description icon text will be used as text.
   There is no default text.

   Access functions:
     * QString text () const
     * void setText ( const QString & text )

   See also iconText.

  toolTip : QString

   This property holds the action's tool tip.

   This text is used for the tool tip. If no status tip has been set the
   tool tip will be used for the status tip.

   If no tool tip is specified the action's text is used.

   Access functions:
     * QString toolTip () const
     * void setToolTip ( const QString & tip )

   See also setStatusTip() and setShortcut().

  visible : bool

   This property holds whether the action can be seen (e.g. in menus and
   toolbars).

   If visible is true the action can be seen (e.g. in menus and toolbars)
   and chosen by the user; if visible is false the action cannot be seen
   or chosen by the user.

   Actions which are not visible are not grayed out; they do not appear
   at all.

   Access functions:
     * bool isVisible () const
     * void setVisible ( bool )

  whatsThis : QString

   This property holds the action's "What's This?" help text.

   The "What's This?" text is used to provide a brief description of the
   action. The text may contain rich text. There is no default "What's
   This?" text.

   Access functions:
     * QString whatsThis () const
     * void setWhatsThis ( const QString & what )

   See also QWhatsThis and QStyleSheet.

Member Function Documentation

  QAction::QAction ( QObject * parent )

   Constructs an action with parent. If parent is an action group the
   action will be automatically inserted into the group.

  QAction::QAction ( const QString & text, QObject * parent )

   Constructs an action with some text and parent. If parent is an action
   group the action will be automatically inserted into the group.

   The action uses a stripped version of text (e.g. "&Menu Option..."
   becomes "Menu Option") as descriptive text for toolbuttons. You can
   override this by setting a specific description with setText(). The
   same text will be used for tool tips unless you specify a different
   test using setToolTip().

  QAction::QAction ( const QIcon & icon, const QString & text, QObject * parent
  )

   Constructs an action with an icon and some text and parent. If parent
   is an action group the action will be automatically inserted into the
   group.

   The action uses a stripped version of text (e.g. "&Menu Option..."
   becomes "Menu Option") as descriptive text for toolbuttons. You can
   override this by setting a specific description with setText(). The
   same text will be used for tool tips unless you specify a different
   test using setToolTip().

  QAction::~QAction ()

   Destroys the object and frees allocated resources.

  QActionGroup * QAction::actionGroup () const

   Returns the action group for this action. If no action group manages
   this action then 0 will be returned.

   See also QActionGroup and QAction::setActionGroup().

  void QAction::activate ( ActionEvent event )

   Sends the relevant signals for ActionEvent event.

   Action based widgets use this API to cause the QAction to emit signals
   as well as emitting their own.

  void QAction::changed ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when an action has changed. If you are only
   interested in actions in a given widget, you can watch for
   QWidget::actionEvent() sent with an QEvent::ActionChanged.

   See also QWidget::actionEvent().

  QVariant QAction::data () const

   Returns the user data as set in QAction::setData.

   See also setData().

  void QAction::hover ()   [slot]

   This is a convenience slot that calls activate(Hover).

  void QAction::hovered ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when an action is highlighted by the user; for
   example, when the user pauses with the cursor over a menu option,
   toolbar button, or presses an action's shortcut key combination.

   See also QAction::activate().

  bool QAction::isSeparator () const

   Returns true if this action is a separator action; otherwise it
   returns false.

   See also QAction::setSeparator().

  QMenu * QAction::menu () const

   Returns the menu contained by this action. Actions that contain menus
   can be used to create menu items with submenus, or inserted into
   toolbars to create buttons with popup menus.

   See also QMenu::addAction().

  QWidget * QAction::parentWidget () const

   Returns the parent widget.

  void QAction::setActionGroup ( QActionGroup * group )

   Sets this action group to group. The action will be automatically
   added to the group's list of actions.

   Actions within the group will be mutually exclusive.

   See also QActionGroup and QAction::actionGroup().

  void QAction::setData ( const QVariant & data )

   Sets internal data to data. This can be used for user data to store
   anything that a QVariant can store. The ownership of anything the the
   user data will remain with the variant and thus be referenced counted
   as appropriate.

   See also data().

  void QAction::setDisabled ( bool b )   [slot]

   This is a convenience function for the enabled property, that is
   useful for signals--slots connections. If b is true the action is
   disabled; otherwise it is enabled.

  void QAction::setMenu ( QMenu * menu )

   Sets the menu contained by this action.

  void QAction::setSeparator ( bool b )

   If b is true then this action will be considered a separator.

   How a separator is represented depends on the widget it is inserted
   into. Under most circumstances the text, submenu, and icon will be
   ignored for separator actions.

   See also QAction::isSeparator().

  bool QAction::showStatusText ( QWidget * widget = 0 )

   Updates the status bar for widget. If widget is an appropriate
   QStatusBar found for for this action based on the parent heirarchy
   will be used.

   See also statusTip.

  void QAction::toggle ()   [slot]

   This is a convenience function for the checked property. Connect to it
   to change the checked state to its opposite state.

  void QAction::toggled ( bool checked )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted whenever a checkable action changes its
   isChecked() status. This can be the result of a user interaction, or
   because setChecked() was called.

   checked is true if the action is checked, or false if the action is
   unchecked.

   See also QAction::activate(), QAction::triggered(), and checked.

  void QAction::trigger ()   [slot]

   This is a convenience slot that calls activate(Trigger).

  void QAction::triggered ( bool checked = false )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when an action is activated by the user; for
   example, when the user clicks a menu option, toolbar button, or
   presses an action's shortcut key combination, or when trigger() was
   called. Notably, it is not emitted when setChecked() or toggle() is
   called.

   If the action is checkable, checked is true if the action is checked,
   or false if the action is unchecked.

   See also QAction::activate(), QAction::toggled(), and checked.
