Detailed Description

   The QSettings class provides persistent platform-independent
   application settings.

   Users normally expect an application to remember its settings (window
   sizes and positions, options, etc.) across sessions. This information
   is often stored in the system registry on Windows, and in XML
   preferences files on Mac OS X. On X11 and embedded Linux, in the
   absense of a standard, many applications (including the KDE
   applications) use INI text files.

   QSettings is an abstraction around these technologies, enabling you to
   save and restore application settings in a portable manner.

   QSettings's API is based on QVariant, allowing you to save most
   value-based types, such as QString, QRect, and QImage, with the
   minimum of effort.

  Basic Usage

   When creating a QSettings object, you must pass the name of your
   company or organization as well as the name of your application. For
   example, if your product is called Star Runner and your company is
   called MySoft, you would construct the QSettings object as follows:
        QSettings settings("mysoft.org", "StarRunner");

   QSettings objects can be created either on the stack or on the heap
   (i.e. using new). Constructing and destroying a QSettings object is
   very fast.

   If you use QSettings from many places in your application, you might
   want to specify the organization name and the application name using
   QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName() and
   QCoreApplication::setApplicationName(), and then use the default
   QSettings constructor:
        QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName("MySoft");
        QCoreApplication::setOrganizationDomain("mysoft.com");
        QCoreApplication::setApplicationName("Star Runner");
        ...
        QSettings settings;

   (Here, we also specify the organization's Internet domain. When the
   Internet domain is set, it is used on Mac OS X instead of the
   organization name, since Mac OS X applications conventionally use
   Internet domains to identify themselves. If no domain is set, a fake
   domain is derived from the organization name. See the
   Platform-Specific Notes below for details.)

   QSettings stores settings. Each setting consists of a QString that
   specifies the setting's name (the key) and a QVariant that stores the
   data associated with the key. To write a setting, use setValue(). For
   example:
        settings.setValue("editor/wrapMargin", 68);

   If there already exists a setting with the same key, the existing
   value is overwritten by the new value. For efficiency, the changes may
   not be saved to permanent storage immediately. (You can always call
   sync() to commit your changes.)

   You can get a setting's value back using value():
        int margin = settings.value("editor/wrapMargin").toInt();

   If there is no setting with the specified name, QSettings returns a
   null QVariant (which can be converted to the integer 0). You can
   specify another default value by passing a second argument to value():
        int margin = settings.value("editor/wrapMargin", 80).toInt();

   To test whether a given key exists, call contains(). To remove the
   setting associated with a key, call remove(). To obtain the list of
   all keys, call allKeys(). To remove all keys, call clear().

  QVariant and GUI Types

   Because QVariant is part of the QtCore library, it cannot provide
   conversion functions to data types such as QColor, QImage, and
   QPixmap, which are part of QtGui. In other words, there is no
   QVariant::toColor() function.

   Instead, you can use the QVariant::value() or the qVariantValue()
   template function. For example:
    QSettings settings("MySoft", "Star Runner");
    QColor color = settings.value("DataPump/bgcolor").value<QColor>();

   The inverse conversion (e.g., from QColor to QVariant) is automatic
   for all data types supported by QVariant, including GUI-related types:
    QSettings settings("MySoft", "Star Runner");
    QColor color = palette().background().color();
    settings.setValue("DataPump/bgcolor", color);

  Key Syntax

   Setting keys can contain any Unicode characters. The Windows registry
   and INI files use case-insensitive keys, whereas the Carbon
   Preferences API on Mac OS X uses case-sensitive keys. To avoid
   portability problems, follow these two simple rules:
    1. Always refer to the same key using the same case. For example, if
       you refer to a key as "text fonts" in one place in your code,
       don't refer to it as "Text Fonts" somewhere else.
    2. Avoid key names that are identical except for the case. For
       example, if you have a key called "MainWindow", don't try to save
       another key as "mainwindow".

   You can form hierarchical keys using the '/' character as a separator,
   similar to Unix file paths. For example:
        settings.setValue("mainwindow/size", win->size());
        settings.setValue("mainwindow/fullScreen", win->isFullScreen());
        settings.setValue("outputpanel/visible", panel->isVisible());

   If you want to save or restore many settings with the same prefix, you
   can specify the prefix using beginGroup() and call endGroup() at the
   end. Here's the same example again, but this time using the group
   mechanism:
        settings.beginGroup("mainwindow");
        settings.setValue("size", win->size());
        settings.setValue("fullScreen", win->isFullScreen());
        settings.endGroup();

        settings.beginGroup("outputpanel");
        settings.setValue("visible", panel->isVisible());
        settings.endGroup();

   If a group is set using beginGroup(), the behavior of most functions
   changes consequently. Groups can be set recursively.

   In addition to groups, QSettings also supports an "array" concept. See
   beginReadArray() and beginWriteArray() for details.

  Fallback Mechanism

   Let's assume that you have created a QSettings object with the
   organization name MySoft and the application name Star Runner. When
   you look up a value, up to four locations are searched in that order:
    1. a user-specific location for the Star Runner application
    2. a user-spefific location for all applications by MySoft
    3. a system-wide location for the Star Runner application
    4. a system-wide location for all applications by MySoft

   On Unix with X11 and on embedded Linux, these locations are the
   following files:
    1. $HOME/.config/MySoft/Star Runner.conf
    2. $HOME/.config/MySoft.conf
    3. /etc/xdg/MySoft/Star Runner.conf
    4. /etc/xdg/MySoft.conf

   On Mac OS X versions 10.2 and 10.3, these files are used:
    1. $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.MySoft.Star Runner.plist
    2. $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.MySoft.plist
    3. /Library/Preferences/com.MySoft.Star Runner.plist
    4. /Library/Preferences/com.MySoft.plist

   On Windows, the settings are stored in the following registry paths:
    1. HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MySoft\Star Runner
    2. HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MySoft
    3. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MySoft\Star Runner
    4. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\MySoft

   If a key cannot be found in the first location, the search goes on in
   the second location, and so on. This enables you to store system-wide
   or organization-wide settings and to override them on a per-user or
   per-application basis. To turn off this mechanism, call
   setFallbacksEnabled(false).

   Although keys from all four locations are available for reading, only
   the first file (the user-specific location for the application at
   hand) is accessible for writing. To write to any of the other files,
   omit the application name and/or specify QSettings::SystemScope (as
   opposed to QSettings::UserScope, the default).

   Let's see with an example:
        QSettings obj1("MySoft", "Star Runner");
        QSettings obj2("MySoft");
        QSettings obj3(QSettings::SystemScope, "MySoft", "Star Runner");
        QSettings obj4(QSettings::SystemScope, "MySoft");

   The table below summarizes which QSettings objects access which
   location. "X" means that the location is the main location associated
   to the QSettings object and is used both for reading and for writing;
   "o" means that the location is used as a fallback when reading.

                       Locations        obj1 obj2 obj3 obj4
                 1. User, Application    X            
                 2. User, Organization   o    X       
                3. System, Application   o         X  
                4. System, Organization  o    o    o    X

   The beauty of this mechanism is that it works on all platforms
   supported by Qt and that it still gives you a lot of flexibility,
   without requiring you to specify any file names or registry paths.

   If you want to use INI files on all platforms instead of the native
   API, you can pass QSettings::IniFormat as the first argument to the
   QSettings constructor, followed by the scope, the organization name,
   and the application name:
        QSettings settings(QSettings::IniFormat, QSettings::UserScope,
                           "MySoft", "Star Runner");

   Sometimes you do want to access settings stored in a specific file or
   registry path. In that case, you can use a constructor that takes a
   file name (or registry path) and a file format. For example:
        QSettings settings("starrunner.ini", QSettings::IniFormat);

   The file format can either be QSettings::IniFormat or
   QSettings::NativeFormat. On Mac OS X, the native format is an
   XML-based format called plist. On Windows, the native format is the
   Windows registry, and the first argument is a path in the registry
   rather than a file name, for example:
        QSettings settings("HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft",
                           QSettings::NativeFormat);

   On X11 and embedded Linux, QSettings::IniFormat and
   QSettings::NativeFormat have the same meaning.

   The Settings Editor example lets you experiment with different
   settings location and with fallbacks turned on or off.

  Restoring the State of a GUI Application

   QSettings is often used to store the state of a GUI application. The
   following example will illustrate how to use we will use QSettings to
   save and restore the geometry of an application's main window.
    void MainWindow::writeSettings()
    {
        QSettings settings("Moose Soft", "Clipper");

        settings.beginGroup("MainWindow");
        settings.setValue("size", size());
        settings.setValue("pos", pos());
        settings.endGroup();
    }

    void MainWindow::readSettings()
    {
        QSettings settings("Moose Soft", "Clipper");

        settings.beginGroup("MainWindow");
        resize(settings.value("size", QSize(400, 400)));
        move(settings.value("pos", QPoint(200, 200)));
        settings.endGroup();
    }

   See Window Geometry for a discussion on why it is better to call
   QWidget::resize() and QWidget::move() rather than
   QWidget::setGeometry() to restore a window's geometry.

   The readSettings() and writeSettings() functions must be called from
   the main window's constructor and close event handler as follows:
    MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent)
        : QMainWindow(parent)
    {
        ...
        readSettings();
    }

    void MainWindow::closeEvent(QCloseEvent *event)
    {
        if (userReallyWantsToQuit()) {
            writeSettings();
            event->accept();
        } else {
            event->ignore();
        }
    }

   See the Application example for a self-contained example that uses
   QSettings.

  Accessing Settings from Multiple Threads or Processes Simultaneously

   QSettings is reentrant. This means that you can use distinct QSettings
   object in different threads simultaneously. This guarantee stands even
   when the QSettings objects refer to the same files on disk (or to the
   same entries in the system registry). If a setting is modified through
   one QSettings object, the change will immediately be visible in any
   other QSettings objects that operate on the same location and that
   live in the same process.

   QSettings can safely be used from different processes (which can be
   different instances of your application running at the same time or
   different applications altogether) to read and write to the same
   system locations. It uses a smart merging algorithm to ensure data
   integrity. Changes performed by another process aren't visible in the
   current process until sync() is called.

  Platform-Specific Notes

   While QSettings attempts to smooth over the differences between the
   different supported platforms, there are still a few differences that
   you should be aware of when porting your application:
     * The Windows system registry has the following limitations: A
       subkey may not exceed 255 characters, an entry's value may not
       exceed 16,383 characters, and all the values of a key may not
       exceed 65,535 characters. One way to work around these limitations
       is to store the settings using the IniFormat instead of the
       NativeFormat.
     * On Mac OS X, allKeys() will return some extra keys for global
       settings that apply to all applications. These keys can be read
       using value() but cannot be changed, only shadowed. Calling
       setFallbacksEnabled(false) will hide these global settings.
     * On Mac OS X, the APIs used by QSettings expect an Internet domain
       name rather than an organization name. To provide a uniform API,
       QSettings derives a fake domain name from the organization name
       (unless the organization name already is a domain name, e.g.
       OpenOffice.org). The algorithm appends ".com" to the company name
       and replaces spaces and other illegal characters with hyphens. If
       you want to specify a different domain name, call
       QCoreApplication::setOrganizationDomain(),
       QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName(), and
       QCoreApplication::setApplicationName() in your main() function and
       then use the default QSettings constructor. Another solution is to
       use preprocessor directives, for example:
    #ifdef Q_WS_MAC
        QSettings settings("grenoullelogique.fr", "Squash");
    #else
        QSettings settings("Grenoulle Logique", "Squash");
    #endif

Member Type Documentation

  enum QSettings::Format

   This enum type specifies the storage format used by QSettings.

   Constant Value Description
   QSettings::NativeFormat 0 Store the settings using the most
   appropriate storage format for the platform. On Windows, this means
   the system registry; on Mac OS X, this means the CFPreferences API; on
   Unix/X11, this means textual configuration files in INI format.
   QSettings::IniFormat 1 Store the settings in INI files.

   On Unix/X11, NativeFormat and IniFormat mean the same thing, except
   that the file extension is different (.conf for NativeFormat, .ini for
   IniFormat).

   The INI file format is a Windows file format that Qt supports on all
   platforms.

  enum QSettings::Scope

   This enum specifies whether settings are user-specific or shared by
   all users of the same system.

   Constant Value Description
   QSettings::UserScope 0 Store settings in a location specific to the
   current user (e.g., in the user's home directory).
   QSettings::SystemScope 1 Store settings in a global location, so that
   all users on the same machine access the same set of settings.

  enum QSettings::Status

   The following status values are possible:

   Constant Value Description
   QSettings::NoError 0 No error occurred.
   QSettings::AccessError 1 An access error occurred (e.g. trying to
   write to a read-only file).
   QSettings::FormatError 2 A format error occurred (e.g. loading a
   malformed INI file).

   See also status().

Member Function Documentation

  QSettings::QSettings ( const QString & organization, const QString &
  application = QString(), QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QSettings object for accessing settings of the
   application called application from the organization called
   organization, and with parent parent.

   Example:
    QSettings settings("Moose Tech", "Facturo-Pro");

   The scope is QSettings::UserScope and the format is
   QSettings::NativeFormat.

   See also Fallback Mechanism.

  QSettings::QSettings ( Scope scope, const QString & organization, const
  QString & application = QString(), QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QSettings object for accessing settings of the
   application called application from the organization called
   organization, and with parent parent.

   If scope is QSettings::UserScope, the QSettings object searches
   user-specific settings first, before it searches system-wide settings
   as a fallback. If scope is QSettings::SystemScope, the QSettings
   object ignores user-specific settings and provides access to
   system-wide settings.

   The storage format is always QSettings::NativeFormat.

   If no application name is given, the QSettings object will only access
   the organization-wide locations.

  QSettings::QSettings ( Format format, Scope scope, const QString &
  organization, const QString & application = QString(), QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QSettings object for accessing settings of the
   application called application from the organization called
   organization, and with parent parent.

   If scope is QSettings::UserScope, the QSettings object searches
   user-specific settings first, before it searches system-wide settings
   as a fallback. If scope is QSettings::SystemScope, the QSettings
   object ignores user-specific settings and provides access to
   system-wide settings.

   If format is QSettings::NativeFormat, the native API is used for
   storing settings. If format is QSettings::IniFormat, the INI format is
   used.

   If no application name is given, the QSettings object will only access
   the organization-wide locations.

  QSettings::QSettings ( const QString & fileName, Format format, QObject *
  parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QSettings object for accessing the settings stored in the
   file called fileName, with parent parent. If the file doesn't already
   exist, it is created.

   If format is QSettings::NativeFormat, the meaning of fileName depends
   on the platform. On Unix/X11, fileName is the name of an INI file. On
   Mac OS X, fileName is the name of a .plist file. On Windows, fileName
   is a path in the system registry.

   If format is QSettings::IniFormat, fileName is the name of an INI
   file.

   See also fileName().

  QSettings::QSettings ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QSettings object for accessing settings of the
   application and organization set previously with a call to
   QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName(),
   QCoreApplication::setOrganizationDomain(), and
   QCoreApplication::setApplicationName().

   The scope is QSettings::UserScope and the format is
   QSettings::NativeFormat.

   The code
    QSettings settings("Moose Soft", "Facturo-Pro");

   is equivalent to
    QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName("Moose Soft");
    QCoreApplication::setApplicationName("Facturo-Pro");
    QSettings settings;

   If QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName() and
   QCoreApplication::setApplicationName() has not been previously called,
   the QSettings object will not be able to read or write any settings,
   and status() will return AccessError.

   On Mac OS X, if both a name and an Internet domain are specified for
   the organization, the domain is preferred over the name. On other
   platforms, the name is preferred over the domain.

   See also QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName(),
   QCoreApplication::setOrganizationDomain(), and
   QCoreApplication::setApplicationName().

  QSettings::~QSettings ()

   Destroys the QSettings object.

   Any unsaved changes will eventually be written to permanent storage.

   See also sync().

  QStringList QSettings::allKeys () const

   Returns a list of all keys, including subkeys, that can be read using
   the QSettings object.

   Example:
    QSettings settings;
    settings.setValue("fridge/color", Qt::white);
    settings.setValue("fridge/size", QSize(32, 96));
    settings.setValue("sofa", true);
    settings.setValue("tv", false);

    QStringList keys = settings.allKeys();
    // keys: ["fridge/color", "fridge/size", "sofa", "tv"]

   If a group is set using beginGroup(), only the keys in the group are
   returned, without the group prefix:
    settings.beginGroup("fridge");
    keys = settings.allKeys();
    // keys: ["color", "size"]

   See also childGroups() and childKeys().

  void QSettings::beginGroup ( const QString & prefix )

   Appends prefix to the current group.

   The current group is automatically prepended to all keys specified to
   QSettings. In addition, query functions such as childGroups(),
   childKeys(), and allKeys() are based on the group. By default, no
   group is set.

   Groups are useful to avoid typing in the same setting paths over and
   over. For example:
    settings.beginGroup("mainwindow");
    settings.setValue("size", win->size());
    settings.setValue("fullScreen", win->isFullScreen());
    settings.endGroup();

    settings.beginGroup("outputpanel");
    settings.setValue("visible", panel->isVisible());
    settings.endGroup();

   This will set the value of three settings:
     * mainwindow/size
     * mainwindow/fullScreen
     * outputpanel/visible

   Call endGroup() to reset the current group to what it was before the
   corresponding beginGroup() call. Groups can be nested.

   See also endGroup() and group().

  int QSettings::beginReadArray ( const QString & prefix )

   Adds prefix to the current group and starts reading from an array.
   Returns the size of the array.

   Example:
    struct Login {
        QString userName;
        QString password;
    };
    QList<Login> logins;
    ...

    QSettings settings;
    int size = settings.beginReadArray("logins");
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        settings.setArrayIndex(i);
        Login login;
        login.userName = settings.value("userName");
        login.password = settings.value("password");
        logins.append(login);
    }
    settings.endArray();

   Use beginWriteArray() to write the array in the first place.

   See also beginWriteArray(), endArray(), and setArrayIndex().

  void QSettings::beginWriteArray ( const QString & prefix, int size = -1 )

   Adds prefix to the current group and starts writing an array of size
   size. If size is -1 (the default), it is automatically determined
   based on the indexes of the entries written.

   If you have many occurrences of a certain set of keys, you can use
   arrays to make your life easier. For example, let's suppose that you
   want to save a variable-length list of user names and passwords. You
   could then write:
    struct Login {
        QString userName;
        QString password;
    };
    QList<Login> logins;
    ...

    QSettings settings;
    settings.beginWriteArray("logins");
    for (int i = 0; i < logins.size(); ++i) {
        settings.setArrayIndex(i);
        settings.setValue("userName", list.at(i).userName);
        settings.setValue("password", list.at(i).password);
    }
    settings.endArray();

   The generated keys will have the form
     * logins/1/userName
     * logins/1/password
     * logins/2/userName
     * logins/2/password
     * logins/3/userName
     * logins/3/password
     * ...

   To read back an array, use beginReadArray().

   See also beginReadArray(), endArray(), and setArrayIndex().

  QStringList QSettings::childGroups () const

   Returns a list of all key top-level groups that contain keys that can
   be read using the QSettings object.

   Example:
    QSettings settings;
    settings.setValue("fridge/color", Qt::white);
    settings.setValue("fridge/size", QSize(32, 96));
    settings.setValue("sofa", true);
    settings.setValue("tv", false);

    QStringList groups = settings.childGroups();
    // group: ["fridge"]

   If a group is set using beginGroup(), the first-level keys in that
   group are returned, without the group prefix.
    settings.beginGroup("fridge");
    groups = settings.childGroups();
    // groups: []

   You can navigate through the entire setting hierarchy using
   childKeys() and childGroups() recursively.

   See also childKeys() and allKeys().

  QStringList QSettings::childKeys () const

   Returns a list of all top-level keys that can be read using the
   QSettings object.

   Example:
    QSettings settings;
    settings.setValue("fridge/color", Qt::white);
    settings.setValue("fridge/size", QSize(32, 96));
    settings.setValue("sofa", true);
    settings.setValue("tv", false);

    QStringList keys = settings.childKeys();
    // keys: ["sofa", "tv"]

   If a group is set using beginGroup(), the top-level keys in that group
   are returned, without the group prefix:
    settings.beginGroup("fridge");
    keys = settings.childKeys();
    // keys: ["color", "size"]

   You can navigate through the entire setting hierarchy using
   childKeys() and childGroups() recursively.

   See also childGroups() and allKeys().

  void QSettings::clear ()

   Removes all entries in the primary location associated to this
   QSettings object.

   Entries in fallback locations are not removed.

   If you only want to remove the entries in the current group(), use
   remove("") instead.

   See also remove() and setFallbacksEnabled().

  bool QSettings::contains ( const QString & key ) const

   Returns true if there exists a setting called key; returns false
   otherwise.

   If a group is set using beginGroup(), key is taken to be relative to
   that group.

   See also value() and setValue().

  void QSettings::endArray ()

   Closes the array that was started using beginReadArray() or
   beginWriteArray().

   See also beginReadArray() and beginWriteArray().

  void QSettings::endGroup ()

   Resets the group to what it was before the corresponding beginGroup()
   call.

   Example:
    settings.beginGroup("alpha");
    // settings.group() == "alpha"

    settings.beginGroup("beta");
    // settings.group() == "alpha/beta"

    settings.endGroup();
    // settings.group() == "alpha"

    settings.endGroup();
    // settings.group() == ""

   See also beginGroup() and group().

  bool QSettings::fallbacksEnabled () const

   Returns true if fallbacks are enabled; returns false otherwise.

   By default, fallbacks are enabled.

   See also setFallbacksEnabled().

  QString QSettings::fileName () const

   Returns the path where settings written using this QSettings object
   are stored.

   On Windows, if the format is QSettings::NativeFormat, the return value
   is a system registry path, not a file path.

   See also isWritable().

  QString QSettings::group () const

   Returns the current group.

   See also beginGroup() and endGroup().

  bool QSettings::isWritable () const

   Returns true if settings can be written using this QSettings object;
   returns false otherwise.

   One reason why isWritable() might return false is if QSettings
   operates on a read-only file.

   See also fileName() and status().

  void QSettings::remove ( const QString & key )

   Removes the setting key and any sub-settings of key.

   Example:
    QSettings settings;
    settings.setValue("ape");
    settings.setValue("monkey", 1);
    settings.setValue("monkey/sea", 2);
    settings.setValue("monkey/doe", 4);

    settings.remove("monkey");
    QStringList keys = settings.allKeys();
    // keys: ["ape"]

   Be aware that if one of the fallback locations contains a setting with
   the same key, that setting will be visible after calling remove().

   If key is an empty string, all keys in the current group() are
   removed. For example:
    QSettings settings;
    settings.setValue("ape");
    settings.setValue("monkey", 1);
    settings.setValue("monkey/sea", 2);
    settings.setValue("monkey/doe", 4);

    settings.beginGroup("monkey");
    settings.remove("");
    settings.endGroup();

    QStringList keys = settings.allKeys();
    // keys: ["ape"]

   See also setValue(), value(), and contains().

  void QSettings::setArrayIndex ( int i )

   Sets the current array index to i. Calls to functions such as
   setValue(), value(), remove(), and contains() will operate on the
   array entry at that index.

   You must call beginReadArray() or beginWriteArray() before you can
   call this function.

  void QSettings::setFallbacksEnabled ( bool b )

   Sets whether fallbacks are enabled to b.

   By default, fallbacks are enabled.

   See also fallbacksEnabled().

  void QSettings::setSystemIniPath ( const QString & dir )   [static]

   Sets the directory where QSettings stores its SystemScope .ini files
   to dir.

   On Unix systems, the default directory is /etc/xdg in accordance with
   FreeDesktop's XDG Base Directory Specification. This default can be
   changed when compiling Qt by passing the --sysconfdir flag to
   configure.

   On Windows, the default directory is C:\Documents and Settings\All
   Users\Application Data.

   A call to this function should precede any instantiations of QSettings
   objects.

   See also setUserIniPath().

  void QSettings::setUserIniPath ( const QString & dir )   [static]

   Sets the directory where QSettings stores its UserScope .ini files to
   dir.

   On Unix systems, the default directory is read from the
   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable. If this variable is empty or
   unset, $HOME/.config is used, in accordance with the FreeDesktop's XDG
   Base Directory Specification. Calling this function overrides the path
   specified in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

   On Windows, the default directory is C:\Documents and
   Settings\<username>\Application Data.

   A call to this function should precede any instantiations of QSettings
   objects.

   See also setSystemIniPath().

  void QSettings::setValue ( const QString & key, const QVariant & value )

   Sets the value of setting key to value.

   If the key already exists, the previous value is overwritten.

   Example:
    QSettings settings;
    settings.setValue("interval", 30);
    settings.value("interval").toInt();     // returns 30

    settings.setValue("interval", 6.55);
    settings.value("interval").toDouble();  // returns 6.55

   See also value(), remove(), and contains().

  Status QSettings::status () const

   Returns a status code indicating the first error that was met by
   QSettings, or QSettings::NoError if no error occurred.

  void QSettings::sync ()

   Writes any unsaved changes to permanent storage, and reloads any
   settings that have been changed in the meantime by another
   application.

   Unless you use QSettings as a communication mechanism between
   different processes, you normally don't need to call this function.

  QVariant QSettings::value ( const QString & key, const QVariant &
  defaultValue = QVariant() ) const

   Returns the value for setting key. If the setting doesn't exist,
   returns defaultValue.

   If no default value is specified, a default QVariant is returned.

   Example:
    QSettings settings;
    settings.setValue("animal/snake", 58);
    settings.value("animal/snake", 1024).toInt();   // returns 58
    settings.value("animal/zebra", 1024).toInt();   // returns 1024
    settings.value("animal/zebra").toInt();         // returns 0

   See also setValue(), contains(), and remove().
