Detailed Description

   The QScrollArea class provides a scrolling view onto another widget.

   A scroll area is used to display the contents of a child widget within
   a frame. If the widget exceeds the size of the frame, the view can
   provide scroll bars so that the entire area of the child widget can be
   viewed.

   The child widget must be specified with setWidget(); it can be
   retrieved with widget(). The view can be made to be resizable with the
   setWidgetResizable() function.

   When using a scroll area to display the contents of a custom widget,
   it is important to ensure that the size hint of the child widget is
   set to a suitable value. If a standard QWidget is used for the child
   widget, it may be necessary to call QWidget::setMinimumSize() to
   ensure that the contents of the widget are shown correctly within the
   scroll area.

Property Documentation

  widgetResizable : bool

   This property holds whether the scroll area should resize the view
   widget.

   If this property is set to false (the default), the view honors the
   size of its widget. Regardless of this property, you can
   programmatically resize the widget using widget()->resize(), and the
   scroll area will automatically adjust itself to the new size.

   If this property is set to true, the view will automatically resize
   the widget in order to avoid scroll bars where they can be avoided, or
   to take advantage of extra space.

   Access functions:
     * bool widgetResizable () const
     * void setWidgetResizable ( bool resizable )

Member Function Documentation

  QScrollArea::QScrollArea ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a scroll area with the given parent, and with no widget;
   see setWidget().

  QScrollArea::~QScrollArea ()

   Destroys the scroll area.

  void QScrollArea::setWidget ( QWidget * w )

   Set's the view widget's widget to w.

   w becomes a child of the scroll area, and will be destroyed when the
   scroll area is deleted or when a new view widget is set.

   See also widget().

  QWidget * QScrollArea::takeWidget ()

   Removes the view widget's widget from the view, and passes ownership
   of the widget to the caller.

  QWidget * QScrollArea::widget () const

   Returns the view widget's widget, or 0 if there is none.

   See also setWidget().
