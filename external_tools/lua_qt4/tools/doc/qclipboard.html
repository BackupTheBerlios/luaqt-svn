Detailed Description

   The QClipboard class provides access to the window system clipboard.

   The clipboard offers a simple mechanism to copy and paste data between
   applications.

   QClipboard supports the same data types that QDrag does, and uses
   similar mechanisms. For advanced clipboard usage read Drag and Drop.

   There is a single QClipboard object in an application, accessible as
   QApplication::clipboard().

   Example:
    QClipboard *clipboard = QApplication::clipboard();
    QString originalText = clipboard->text();
    ...
    clipboard->setText(newText);

   QClipboard features some convenience functions to access common data
   types: setText() allows the exchange of Unicode text and setPixmap()
   and setImage() allows the exchange of QPixmaps and QImages between
   applications. The setMimeData() function is the ultimate in
   flexibility: it allows you to add any QMimeData into the clipboard.
   There are corresponding getters for each of these, e.g. text(),
   image() and pixmap(). You can clear the clipboard by calling clear().

  Notes for X11 Users

     * The X11 Window System has the concept of a separate selection and
       clipboard. When text is selected, it is immediately available as
       the global mouse selection. The global mouse selection may later
       be copied to the clipboard. By convention, the middle mouse button
       is used to paste the global mouse selection.
     * X11 also has the concept of ownership; if you change the selection
       within a window, X11 will only notify the owner and the previous
       owner of the change, i.e. it will not notify all applications that
       the selection or clipboard data changed.
     * Lastly, the X11 clipboard is event driven, i.e. the clipboard will
       not function properly if the event loop is not running. Similarly,
       it is recommended that the contents of the clipboard are stored or
       retrieved in direct response to user-input events, e.g. mouse
       button or key presses and releases. You should not store or
       retrieve the clipboard contents in response to timer or
       non-user-input events.

  Notes for Windows and Mac OS X Users

     * Windows and Mac OS X do not support the global mouse selection;
       they only supports the global clipboard, i.e. they only adds text
       to the clipboard when an explicit copy or cut is made.
     * Windows and Mac OS X does not have the concept of ownership; the
       clipboard is a fully global resource so all applications are
       notified of changes.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QClipboard::Mode

   This enum type is used to control which part of the system clipboard
   is used by QClipboard::data(), QClipboard::setData() and related
   functions.

   Constant Value Description
   QClipboard::Clipboard 0 indicates that data should be stored and
   retrieved from the global clipboard.
   QClipboard::Selection 1 indicates that data should be stored and
   retrieved from the global mouse selection.

   Note: Support for Selection is provided only on systems with a global
   mouse selection (e.g. X11).

   See also QClipboard::supportsSelection().

Member Function Documentation

  void QClipboard::clear ( Mode mode = Clipboard )

   Clear the clipboard contents.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, this function
   clears the the global clipboard contents. If mode is
   QClipboard::Selection, this function clears the global mouse selection
   contents.

   See also QClipboard::Mode and supportsSelection().

  void QClipboard::dataChanged ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the clipboard data is changed.

  QImage QClipboard::image ( Mode mode = Clipboard ) const

   Returns the clipboard image, or returns a null image if the clipboard
   does not contain an image or if it contains an image in an unsupported
   image format.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the image is
   retrieved from the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection,
   the image is retrieved from the global mouse selection.

   See also setImage(), pixmap(), data(), and QImage::isNull().

  const QMimeData * QClipboard::mimeData ( Mode mode = Clipboard ) const

   Returns a reference to a QMimeData representation of the current
   clipboard data.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the data is
   retrieved from the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection,
   the data is retrieved from the global mouse selection.

   The text(), image(), and pixmap() functions are simpler wrappers for
   retrieving text, image, and pixmap data.

   See also setMimeData().

  bool QClipboard::ownsClipboard () const

   Returns true if this clipboard object owns the clipboard data;
   otherwise returns false.

  bool QClipboard::ownsSelection () const

   Returns true if this clipboard object owns the mouse selection data;
   otherwise returns false.

  QPixmap QClipboard::pixmap ( Mode mode = Clipboard ) const

   Returns the clipboard pixmap, or null if the clipboard does not
   contain a pixmap. Note that this can lose information. For example, if
   the image is 24-bit and the display is 8-bit, the result is converted
   to 8 bits, and if the image has an alpha channel, the result just has
   a mask.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the pixmap is
   retrieved from the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection,
   the pixmap is retrieved from the global mouse selection.

   See also setPixmap(), image(), data(), and
   QPixmap::convertFromImage().

  void QClipboard::selectionChanged ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the selection is changed. This only
   applies to windowing systems that support selections, e.g. X11.
   Windows doesn't support selections.

  void QClipboard::setImage ( const QImage & image, Mode mode = Clipboard )

   Copies the image into the clipboard.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the image is
   stored in the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection, the
   data is stored in the global mouse selection.

   This is shorthand for:
    QMimeData *data = new QMimeData;
    data->setPixmap(image);
    clipboard->setMimeData(data, mode);

   See also image(), setPixmap(), and setData().

  void QClipboard::setMimeData ( QMimeData * src, Mode mode = Clipboard )

   Sets the clipboard data to src. Ownership of the data is transferred
   to the clipboard. If you want to remove the data either call clear()
   or call setData() again with new data.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the data is
   retrieved from the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection,
   the data is retrieved from the global mouse selection.

   The setText(), setImage() and setPixmap() functions are simpler
   wrappers for setting text, image and pixmap data respectively.

   See also data().

  void QClipboard::setPixmap ( const QPixmap & pixmap, Mode mode = Clipboard )

   Copies pixmap into the clipboard. Note that this is slower than
   setImage() because it needs to convert the QPixmap to a QImage first.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the pixmap is
   stored in the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection, the
   pixmap is stored in the global mouse selection.

   See also pixmap(), setImage(), and setData().

  void QClipboard::setText ( const QString & text, Mode mode = Clipboard )

   Copies text into the clipboard as plain text.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the text is
   stored in the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection, the
   text is stored in the global mouse selection.

   See also text() and setData().

  bool QClipboard::supportsSelection () const

   Returns true if the clipboard supports mouse selection; otherwise
   returns false.

  QString QClipboard::text ( Mode mode = Clipboard ) const

   Returns the clipboard text as plain text, or an empty string if the
   clipboard does not contain any text.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the text is
   retrieved from the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection,
   the text is retrieved from the global mouse selection.

   See also setText() and data().

  QString QClipboard::text ( QString & subtype, Mode mode = Clipboard ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the clipboard text in subtype subtype, or an empty string if
   the clipboard does not contain any text. If subtype is null, any
   subtype is acceptable, and subtype is set to the chosen subtype.

   The mode argument is used to control which part of the system
   clipboard is used. If mode is QClipboard::Clipboard, the text is
   retrieved from the global clipboard. If mode is QClipboard::Selection,
   the text is retrieved from the global mouse selection.

   Common values for subtype are "plain" and "html".

   See also setText() and data().
