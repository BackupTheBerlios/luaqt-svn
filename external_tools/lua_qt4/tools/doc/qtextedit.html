  Introduction and Concepts

   QTextEdit is an advanced WYSIWYG viewer/editor supporting rich text
   formatting using HTML-style tags. It is optimized to handle large
   documents and to respond quickly to user input.

   QTextEdit works on paragraphs and characters. A paragraph is a
   formatted string which is word-wrapped to fit into the width of the
   widget. By default when reading plain text, one newline signifies a
   paragraph. A document consists of zero or more paragraphs. The words
   in the paragraph are aligned in accordance with the paragraph's
   alignment. Paragraphs are separated by hard line breaks. Each
   character within a paragraph has its own attributes, for example, font
   and color.

   QTextEdit can display images, lists and tables. If the text is too
   large to view within the text edit's viewport, scrollbars will appear.
   The text edit can load both plain text and HTML files (a subset of
   HTML 3.2 and 4).

   If you just need to display a small piece of rich text use QLabel.

   Note that we do not intend to add a full-featured web browser widget
   to Qt (because that would easily double Qt's size and only a few
   applications would benefit from it). The rich text support in Qt is
   designed to provide a fast, portable and efficient way to add
   reasonable online help facilities to applications, and to provide a
   basis for rich text editors.

  Using QTextEdit as a Display Widget

   QTextEdit can display a large HTML subset, including tables and
   images.

   The text is set or replaced using setHtml() which deletes any existing
   text and replaces it with the text passed in the setHtml() call. If
   you call setHtml() with legacy HTML, and then call text(), the text
   that is returned may have different markup, but will render the same.
   The entire text can be deleted with clear().

   Text itself can be inserted using the QTextCursor class or using the
   convenience functions insertHtml(), insertPlainText(), append() or
   paste(). QTextCursor is also able to insert complex objects like
   tables or lists into the document, and it deals with creating
   selections and applying changes to selected text.

   By default the text edit wraps words at whitespace to fit within the
   text edit widget. The setLineWrapMode() function is used to specify
   the kind of line wrap you want, or NoWrap if you don't want any
   wrapping. Call setLineWrapMode() to set a fixed pixel width
   FixedPixelWidth, or character column (e.g. 80 column) FixedColumnWidth
   with the pixels or columns specified with setLineWrapColumnOrWidth().
   If you use word wrap to the widget's width WidgetWidth, you can
   specify whether to break on whitespace or anywhere with
   setWrapPolicy().

   The find() function can be used to find and select a given string
   within the text.

    Read-only key bindings

   When QTextEdit is used read-only the key-bindings are limited to
   navigation, and text may only be selected with the mouse:

                             Keypresses Action
                       Qt::UpArrow Moves one line up.
                     Qt::DownArrow Moves one line down.
               Qt::LeftArrow Moves one character to the left.
              Qt::RightArrow Moves one character to the right.
                    PageUp Moves one (viewport) page up.
                  PageDown Moves one (viewport) page down.
                  Home Moves to the beginning of the text.
                     End Moves to the end of the text.
     Shift+Wheel Scrolls the page horizontally (the Wheel is the mouse
                                  wheel).
                         Ctrl+Wheel Zooms the text.

   The text edit may be able to provide some meta-information. For
   example, the documentTitle() function will return the text from within
   HTML <title> tags.

  Using QTextEdit as an Editor

   All the information about using QTextEdit as a display widget also
   applies here.

   The current char format's attributes are set with setFontItalic(),
   setFontBold(), setFontUnderline(), setFontFamily(),
   setFontPointSize(), setTextColor() and setCurrentFont(). The current
   paragraph's alignment is set with setAlignment().

   Selection of text is handled by the QTextCursor class, which provides
   functionality for creating selections, retrieving the text contents or
   deleting selections. You can retrieve the object that corresponds with
   the user-visible cursor using the textCursor() method. If you want to
   set a selection in QTextEdit just create one on a QTextCursor object
   and then make that cursor the visible cursor using setCursor(). The
   selection can be copied to the clipboard with copy(), or cut to the
   clipboard with cut(). The entire text can be selected using
   selectAll().

   When the cursor is moved and the underlying formatting attributes
   change, the currentCharFormatChanged() signal is emitted to reflect
   the new attributes at the new cursor position.

   QTextEdit holds a QTextDocument object which can be retrieved using
   the document() method. You can also set your own document object using
   setDocument(). QTextDocument emits a textChanged() signal if the text
   changes and it also provides a isModified() function which will return
   true if the text has been modified since it was either loaded or since
   the last call to setModified with false as argument. In addition it
   provides methods for undo and redo.

    Editing key bindings

   The list of key-bindings which are implemented for editing:

                             Keypresses Action
         Backspace Deletes the character to the left of the cursor.
          Delete Deletes the character to the right of the cursor.
           Ctrl+A Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
             Ctrl+B Moves the cursor one character to the left.
              Ctrl+C Copy the selected text to the clipboard.
            Ctrl+Insert Copy the selected text to the clipboard.
          Ctrl+D Delete the character to the right of the cursor.
              Ctrl+E Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
            Ctrl+F Moves the cursor one character to the right.
          Ctrl+H Deletes the character to the left of the cursor.
                   Ctrl+K Deletes to the end of the line.
                   Ctrl+N Moves the cursor one line down.
                    Ctrl+P Moves the cursor one line up.
              Ctrl+V Pastes the clipboard text into text edit.
           Shift+Insert Pastes the clipboard text into text edit.
      Ctrl+X Deletes the selected text and copies it to the clipboard.
   Shift+Delete Deletes the selected text and copies it to the clipboard.
                     Ctrl+Z Undoes the last operation.
                     Ctrl+Y Redoes the last operation.
           LeftArrow Moves the cursor one character to the left.
           Ctrl+LeftArrow Moves the cursor one word to the left.
          RightArrow Moves the cursor one character to the right.
          Ctrl+RightArrow Moves the cursor one word to the right.
                   UpArrow Moves the cursor one line up.
                 Ctrl+UpArrow Moves the cursor one word up.
                 DownArrow Moves the cursor one line down.
              Ctrl+Down Arrow Moves the cursor one word down.
                    PageUp Moves the cursor one page up.
                  PageDown Moves the cursor one page down.
            Home Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
          Ctrl+Home Moves the cursor to the beginning of the text.
                End Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
             Ctrl+End Moves the cursor to the end of the text.
     Shift+Wheel Scrolls the page horizontally (the Wheel is the mouse
                                  wheel).
                         Ctrl+Wheel Zooms the text.

   To select (mark) text hold down the Shift key whilst pressing one of
   the movement keystrokes, for example, Shift+Right Arrow will select
   the character to the right, and Shift+Ctrl+Right Arrow will select the
   word to the right, etc.

Property Documentation

  autoFormatting : AutoFormatting

   This property holds the enabled set of auto formatting features.

   The value can be any combination of the values in the
   AutoFormattingFlag enum. The default is AutoNone. Choose AutoAll to
   enable all automatic formatting.

   Currently, the only automatic formatting feature provided is
   AutoBulletList; future versions of Qt may offer more.

   Access functions:
     * AutoFormatting autoFormatting () const
     * void setAutoFormatting ( AutoFormatting features )

  documentTitle : QString

   This property holds the title of the document parsed from the text.

   Access functions:
     * QString documentTitle () const
     * void setDocumentTitle ( const QString & title )

  html : QString

   This property provides an HTML interface to the text of the text edit.

   toHtml() returns the text of the text edit as html.

   setHtml() changes the text of the text edit. Any previous text is
   removed. The input text is interpreted as rich text in html format.

   Note that the undo/redo history is cleared by calling setHtml().

   Access functions:
     * QString toHtml () const
     * void setHtml ( const QString & text )

  lineWrapColumnOrWidth : int

   This property holds the position (in pixels or columns depending on
   the wrap mode) where text will be wrapped.

   If the wrap mode is FixedPixelWidth, the value is the number of pixels
   from the left edge of the text edit at which text should be wrapped.
   If the wrap mode is FixedColumnWidth, the value is the column number
   (in character columns) from the left edge of the text edit at which
   text should be wrapped.

   Access functions:
     * int lineWrapColumnOrWidth () const
     * void setLineWrapColumnOrWidth ( int w )

   See also lineWrapMode.

  lineWrapMode : LineWrapMode

   This property holds the line wrap mode.

   The default mode is WidgetWidth which causes words to be wrapped at
   the right edge of the text edit. Wrapping occurs at whitespace,
   keeping whole words intact. If you want wrapping to occur within words
   use setWrapPolicy(). If you set a wrap mode of FixedPixelWidth or
   FixedColumnWidth you should also call setWrapColumnOrWidth() with the
   width you want.

   Access functions:
     * LineWrapMode lineWrapMode () const
     * void setLineWrapMode ( LineWrapMode mode )

   See also lineWrapColumnOrWidth.

  readOnly : bool

   This property holds whether the text edit is read-only.

   In a read-only text edit the user can only navigate through the text
   and select text; modifying the text is not possible.

   This property's default is false.

   Access functions:
     * bool isReadOnly () const
     * void setReadOnly ( bool ro )

  tabChangesFocus : bool

   This property holds whether Tab changes focus or is accepted as input.

   In some occasions text edits should not allow the user to input
   tabulators or change indentation using the Tab key, as this breaks the
   focus chain. The default is false.

   Access functions:
     * bool tabChangesFocus () const
     * void setTabChangesFocus ( bool b )

  undoRedoEnabled : bool

   This property holds whether undo and redo are enabled.

   Users are only able to undo or redo actions if this property is true,
   and if there is an action that can be undone (or redone).

   Access functions:
     * bool isUndoRedoEnabled () const
     * void setUndoRedoEnabled ( bool enable )

  wordWrapMode : QTextOption::WrapMode

   This property holds the mode QTextEdit will use when wrapping text by
   words.

   Access functions:
     * QTextOption::WrapMode wordWrapMode () const
     * void setWordWrapMode ( QTextOption::WrapMode policy )

   See also QTextOption::WrapMode.

Member Function Documentation

  QTextEdit::QTextEdit ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs an empty QTextEdit with parent parent.

  QTextEdit::QTextEdit ( const QString & text, QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QTextEdit with parent parent. The text edit will display
   the text text. The text is interpreted as html.

  QTextEdit::~QTextEdit ()   [virtual]

   Destructor.

  Qt::Alignment QTextEdit::alignment () const

   Returns the alignment of the current paragraph.

   See also setAlignment().

  QString QTextEdit::anchorAt ( const QPoint & pos ) const

   Returns the reference of the anchor at position pos, or an empty
   string if no anchor exists at that point.

  void QTextEdit::append ( const QString & text )

   Appends a new paragraph with text to the end of the text edit.

  bool QTextEdit::canInsertFromMimeData ( const QMimeData * source ) const
  [virtual protected]

   This function returns true if the contents of the MIME data object,
   specified by source, can be decoded and inserted into the document. It
   is called for example when during a drag operation the mouse enters
   this widget and it is necessary to determine whether it is possible to
   accept the drag.

  void QTextEdit::clear ()   [slot]

   Deletes all the text in the text edit.

   See also cut(), setPlainText(), and setHtml().

  void QTextEdit::contextMenuEvent ( QContextMenuEvent * e )   [virtual
  protected]

   Shows the standard context menu created with
   createStandardContextMenu().

   If you do not want the text edit to have a context menu, you can set
   its contextMenuPolicy to Qt::NoContextMenu. If you want to customize
   the context menu, reimplement this function. If you want to extend the
   standard context menu, reimplement this function, call
   createStandardContextMenu() and extend the menu returned.

   Information about the event is passed in e.
    void TextEdit::contextMenuEvent(QContextMenuEvent * e) {
            QMenu *menu = createStandardContextMenu();
            menu->addAction(My Menu Item");
            //...
            menu->exec(e->globalPos());
            delete menu;
    }

   Reimplemented from QWidget.

  void QTextEdit::copy ()   [slot]

   Copies any selected text to the clipboard.

   See also copyAvailable().

  void QTextEdit::copyAvailable ( bool yes )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when text is selected or de-selected in the
   text edit.

   When text is selected this signal will be emitted with yes set to
   true. If no text has been selected or if the selected text is
   de-selected this signal is emitted with yes set to false.

   If yes is true then copy() can be used to copy the selection to the
   clipboard. If yes is false then copy() does nothing.

   See also selectionChanged().

  QMimeData * QTextEdit::createMimeDataFromSelection () const   [virtual
  protected]

   This function returns a new MIME data object to represent the contents
   of the text edit's current selection. It is called when the selection
   needs to be encapsulated into a new QMimeData object; for example,
   when a drag and drop operation is started, or when data is copyied to
   the clipboard.

   If you reimplement this function, note that the ownership of the
   returned QMimeData object is passed to the caller. The selection can
   be retrieved by using the textCursor() function.

  QMenu * QTextEdit::createStandardContextMenu ()

   This function creates the standard context menu which is shown when
   the user clicks on the line edit with the right mouse button. It is
   called from the default contextMenuEvent() handler. The popup menu's
   ownership is transferred to the caller.

  QTextCharFormat QTextEdit::currentCharFormat () const

   Returns the char format that is used when inserting new text.

  void QTextEdit::currentCharFormatChanged ( const QTextCharFormat & f )
  [signal]

   This signal is emitted if the current character format has changed,
   for example caused by a change of the cursor position.

   The new format is f.

   See also setCurrentCharFormat().

  QFont QTextEdit::currentFont () const

   Returns the font of the current format.

   See also setCurrentFont(), setFontFamily(), and setFontPointSize().

  QTextCursor QTextEdit::cursorForPosition ( const QPoint & pos ) const

   returns a QTextCursor at position pos (in viewport coordinates).

  void QTextEdit::cursorPositionChanged ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted whenever the position of the cursor changed.

  QRect QTextEdit::cursorRect ( const QTextCursor & cursor ) const

   returns a rectangle (in viewport coordinates) that includes the
   cursor.

  QRect QTextEdit::cursorRect () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   returns a rectangle (in viewport coordinates) that includes the cursor
   of the text edit.

  void QTextEdit::cut ()   [slot]

   Copies the selected text to the clipboard and deletes it from the text
   edit.

   If there is no selected text nothing happens.

   See also copy() and paste().

  QTextDocument * QTextEdit::document () const

   Returns a pointer to the underlying document.

   See also setDocument().

  void QTextEdit::ensureCursorVisible ()

   Ensures that the cursor is visible by scrolling the text edit if
   necessary.

  bool QTextEdit::find ( const QString & exp, QTextDocument::FindFlags options
  = 0 )

   Finds the next occurrence of the string, exp, using the given options.
   Returns true if exp was found and changes the cursor to select the
   match; otherwise returns false.

  QString QTextEdit::fontFamily () const

   Returns the font family of the current format.

   See also setFontFamily(), setCurrentFont(), and setFontPointSize().

  bool QTextEdit::fontItalic () const

   Returns true if the font of the current format is italic; otherwise
   returns false.

   See also setFontItalic().

  qreal QTextEdit::fontPointSize () const

   Returns the point size of the font of the current format.

   See also setFontFamily(), setCurrentFont(), and setFontPointSize().

  bool QTextEdit::fontUnderline () const

   Returns true if the font of the current format is underlined;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also setFontUnderline().

  int QTextEdit::fontWeight () const

   Returns the font weight of the current format.

   See also setFontWeight(), setCurrentFont(), and setFontPointSize().

  void QTextEdit::insertFromMimeData ( const QMimeData * source )   [virtual
