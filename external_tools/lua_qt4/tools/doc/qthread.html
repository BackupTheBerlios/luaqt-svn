Detailed Description

   The QThread class provides platform-independent threads.

   A QThread represents a separate thread of control within the program;
   it shares data with all the other threads within the process but
   executes independently in the way that a separate program does on a
   multitasking operating system. Instead of starting in main(), QThreads
   begin executing in run(). To create your own threads, subclass QThread
   and reimplement run(). For example:
    class MyThread : public QThread
    {
    public:
        void run();
    };

    void MyThread::run()
    {
        QTcpSocket socket;
        // connect QTcpSocket's signals somewhere meaningful
        ...
        socket.connectToHost(hostName, portNumber);
        exec();
    }

   This will create a QTcpSocket in the thread and then execute the
   thread's event loop. Use the start() method to begin execution.
   Execution ends when you return from run(), just as an application does
   when it leaves main(). QThread will notifiy you via a signal when the
   thread is started(), finished(), and terminated(), or you can use
   isFinished() and isRunning() to query the state of the thread. Use
   wait() to block until the thread has finished execution.

   Each thread gets its own stack from the operating system. The
   operating system also determines the default size of the stack. You
   can use setStackSize() to set a custom stack size.

   Each QThread can have its own event loop. You can start the event loop
   by calling exec(); you can stop it by calling exit() or quit(). Having
   an event loop in a thread makes it possible to connect signals from
   other threads to slots in this threads, using a mechanism called
   queued connections. It also makes it possible to use classes that
   require the event loop, such as QTimer and QTcpSocket, in the thread.

   In extreme cases, you may want to forcibly terminate() an executing
   thread. However, doing so is dangerous and discouraged. Please read
   the documentation for terminate() and setTerminationEnabled() for
   detailed information.

   The static functions currentThreadId() and currentThread() return
   identifiers for the currently executing thread. The former returns a
   platform specific ID for the thread; the latter returns a QThread
   pointer.

   QThread also provides platform independent sleep functions in varying
   resolutions. Use sleep() for full second resolution, msleep() for
   millisecond resolution, and usleep() for microsecond resolution.

   See also Thread Support in Qt, QThreadStorage, QMutex, QSemaphore, and
   QWaitCondition.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QThread::Priority

   This enum type indicates how the operating system should schedule
   newly created threads.

   Constant Value Description
   QThread::IdlePriority 0 scheduled only when no other threads are
   running.
   QThread::LowestPriority 1 scheduled less often than LowPriority.
   QThread::LowPriority 2 scheduled less often than NormalPriority.
   QThread::NormalPriority 3 the default priority of the operating
   system.
   QThread::HighPriority 4 scheduled more often than NormalPriority.
   QThread::HighestPriority 5 scheduled more often than HighPriority.
   QThread::TimeCriticalPriority 6 scheduled as often as possible.
   QThread::InheritPriority 7 use the same priority as the creating
   thread. This is the default.

Member Function Documentation

  QThread::QThread ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a new thread with the given parent. The thread does not
   begin executing until start() is called.

   See also start().

  QThread::~QThread ()

   Destroys the thread.

   Note that deleting a QThread object will not stop the execution of the
   thread it represents. Deleting a running QThread (i.e. isFinished()
   returns false) will probably result in a program crash. You can wait()
   on a thread to make sure that it has finished.

  QThread * QThread::currentThread ()   [static]

   Returns a pointer to the currently executing QThread. If the current
   thread was not started using the QThread API (e.g., the GUI thread),
   this function returns zero.

  Qt::HANDLE QThread::currentThreadId ()   [static]

   Returns the thread handle of the currently executing thread.

   Warning: The handle returned by this function is used for internal
   purposes and should not be used in any application code. On Windows,
   the returned value is a pseudo-handle for the current thread that
   cannot be used for numerical comparison.

  int QThread::exec ()   [protected]

   Enters the event loop and waits until exit() is called or the main
   widget is destroyed, and returns the value that was set to exit()
   (which is 0 if exit() is called via quit()).

   It is necessary to call this function to start event handling.

   See also quit() and exit().

  void QThread::exit ( int returnCode = 0 )

   Tells the thread's event loop to exit with a return code.

   After calling this function, the thread leaves the event loop and
   returns from the call to QEventLoop::exec(). The QEventLoop::exec()
   function returns returnCode.

   By convention, a returnCode of 0 means success, any non-zero value
   indicates an error.

   Note that unlike the C library function of the same name, this
   function does return to the caller -- it is event processing that
   stops.

   This function does nothing if the thread does not have an event loop.

   See also quit() and QEventLoop.

  void QThread::finished ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the thread has finished executing.

   See also started() and terminated().

  bool QThread::isFinished () const

   Returns true is the thread is finished; otherwise returns false.

   See also isRunning().

  bool QThread::isRunning () const

   Returns true if the thread is running; otherwise returns false.

   See also isFinished().

  void QThread::msleep ( unsigned long msecs )   [static protected]

   Causes the current thread to sleep for msecs milliseconds.

   See also sleep() and usleep().

  void QThread::quit ()   [slot]

   Tells the thread's event loop to exit with return code 0 (success).
   Equivalent to calling QThread::exit(0).

   This function does nothing if the thread does not have an event loop.

   See also exit() and QEventLoop.

  void QThread::run ()   [pure virtual protected]

   This method is pure virtual and must be implemented in derived classes
   in order to do useful work. Returning from this method will end the
   execution of the thread.

   See also wait().

  void QThread::setStackSize ( uint stackSize )

   Sets the maximum stack size for the thread to stackSize. If stackSize
   is greater than zero, the maximum stack size is set to stackSize
   bytes, otherwise the maximum stack size is automatically determined by
   the operating system.

   Warning: Most operating systems place minimum and maximum limits on
   thread stack sizes. The thread will fail to start if the stack size is
   outside these limits.

   See also stackSize().

  void QThread::setTerminationEnabled ( bool enabled = true )   [static
  protected]

   Enables or disables termination of the current thread based on the
   enabled parameter. The thread must have been started by QThread.

   When enabled is false, termination is disabled. Future calls to
   QThread::terminate() will return immediately without effect. Instead,
   the termination is deferred until termination is enabled.

   When enabled is true, termination is enabled. Future calls to
   QThread::terminate() will terminate the thread normally. If
   termination has been deferred (i.e. QThread::terminate() was called
   with termination disabled), this function will terminate the calling
   thread immediately. Note that this function will not return in this
   case.

   See also terminate().

  void QThread::sleep ( unsigned long secs )   [static protected]

   Forces the current thread to sleep for secs seconds.

   See also msleep() and usleep().

  uint QThread::stackSize () const

   Returns the maximum stack size for the thread (if set with
   setStackSize()); otherwise returns zero.

   See also setStackSize().

  void QThread::start ( Priority priority = InheritPriority )   [slot]

   Begins execution of the thread by calling run(), which should be
   reimplemented in a QThread subclass to contain your code. The
   operating system will schedule the thread according to the priority
   parameter. If the thread is already running, this function does
   nothing.

   See also run() and terminate().

  void QThread::started ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the thread starts executing.

   See also finished() and terminated().

  void QThread::terminate ()   [slot]

   Terminates the execution of the thread. The thread may or may not be
   terminated immediately, depending on the operating systems scheduling
   policies. Use QThread::wait() after terminate() for synchronous
   termination.

   When the thread is terminated, all threads waiting for the thread to
   finish will be woken up.

   Warning: This function is dangerous and its use is discouraged. The
   thread can be terminate at any point in its code path. Threads can be
   terminated while modifying data. There is no chance for the thread to
   cleanup after itself, unlock any held mutexes, etc. In short, use this
   function only if absolutely necessary.

   Termination can be explicitly enabled or disabled by calling
   QThread::setTerminationEnabled(). Calling this function while
   termination is disabled results in the termination being deferred,
   until termination is re-enabled. See the documentation of
   QThread::setTerminationEnabled() for more information.

   See also setTerminationEnabled().

  void QThread::terminated ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the thread is terminated.

   See also started() and finished().

  void QThread::usleep ( unsigned long usecs )   [static protected]

   Causes the current thread to sleep for usecs microseconds.

   See also sleep() and msleep().

  bool QThread::wait ( unsigned long time = ULONG_MAX )

   Blocks the thread until either of these conditions is met:
     * The thread associated with this QThread object has finished
       execution (i.e. when it returns from run()). This function will
       return true if the thread has finished. It also returns true if
       the thread has not been started yet.
     * time milliseconds has elapsed. If time is ULONG_MAX (the default),
       then the wait will never timeout (the thread must return from
       run()). This function will return false if the wait timed out.

   This provides similar functionality to the POSIX pthread_join()
   function.

   See also sleep() and terminate().
