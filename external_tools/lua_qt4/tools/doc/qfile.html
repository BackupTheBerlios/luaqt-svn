Detailed Description

   The QFile class provides an interface for reading from and writing to
   files.

   QFile is an I/O device for reading and writing text and binary files
   and resources. A QFile may be used by itself or, more conveniently,
   with a QTextStream or QDataStream.

   The file name is usually passed in the constructor, but it can be set
   at any time using setFileName(). You can check for a file's existence
   using exists(), and remove a file using remove(). (More advanced file
   system related operations are provided by QFileInfo and QDir.)

   The file is opened with open(), closed with close(), and flushed with
   flush(). Data is usually read and written using QDataStream or
   QTextStream, but you can also call the QIODevice-inherited functions
   read(), readLine(), readAll(), write(). QFile also inherits getChar(),
   putChar(), and ungetChar(), which work one character at a time.

   The size of the file is returned by size(). You can get the current
   file position using pos(), or move to a new file position using
   seek(). If you've reached the end of the file, atEnd() returns true.

   The following example reads a text file line by line:
        QFile file("in.txt");
        if (!file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly | QIODevice::Text))
            return;

        while (!file.atEnd()) {
            QByteArray line = in.readLine();
            process_line(line);
        }

   The QIODevice::Text flag passed to open() tells Qt to convert
   Windows-style line terminators ("\r\n") into C++-style terminators
   ("\n"). By default, QFile assumes binary, i.e. it doesn't perform any
   conversion on the bytes stored in the file.

   The next example uses QTextStream to read a text file line by line:
        QFile file("in.txt");
        if (!file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly | QIODevice::Text))
            return;

        QTextStream in(&file);
        while (!in.atEnd()) {
            QString line = in.readLine();
            process_line(line);
        }

   QTextStream takes care of converting the 8-bit data stored on disk
   into a 16-bit Unicode QString. By default, it assumes that the user
   system's local 8-bit encoding is used (e.g., ISO 8859-1 for most of
   Europe; see QTextCodec::codecForLocale() for details). This can be
   changed using setCodec().

   To write text, we can use operator<<(), which is overloaded to take a
   QTextStream on the left and various data types (including QString) on
   the right:
        QFile file("out.txt");
        if (!file.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly | QIODevice::Text))
            return;

        QTextStream out(&file);
        out << "The magic number is: " << 49 << "\n";

   QDataStream is similar, in that you can use operator<<() to write data
   and operator>>() to read it back. See the class documentation for
   details.

   When you use QFile, QFileInfo, and QDir to access the file system with
   Qt, you can use Unicode file names. On Unix, these file names are
   converted to an 8-bit encoding. If you want to use standard C++ APIs
   (<cstdio> or <iostream>) or platform-specific APIs to access files
   instead of QFile, you can use the encodeName() and decodeName()
   functions to convert between Unicode file names and 8-bit file names.

   See also QTextStream, QDataStream, QFileInfo, QDir, and The Qt
   Resource System.

Member Type Documentation

  typedef QFile::DecoderFn

   This is a typedef for a pointer to a function with the following
   signature:
    QString myDecoderFunc(const QByteArray &localFileName);

   See also setDecodingFunction().

  typedef QFile::EncoderFn

   This is a typedef for a pointer to a function with the following
   signature:
    QByteArray myEncoderFunc(const QString &fileName);

   See also setEncodingFunction() and encodeName().

  enum QFile::FileError

   This enum describes the errors that may be returned by the error()
   function.

          Constant         Value                  Description
   QFile::NoError            0   No error occurred.
   QFile::ReadError          1   An error occurred when reading from the file.
   QFile::WriteError         2   An error occurred when writing to the file.
   QFile::FatalError         3   A fatal error occurred.
   QFile::ResourceError      4  
   QFile::OpenError          5   The file could not be opened.
   QFile::AbortError         6   The operation was aborted.
   QFile::TimeOutError       7   A timeout occurred.
   QFile::UnspecifiedError   8   An unspecified error occurred.
   QFile::RemoveError        9   The file could not be removed.
   QFile::RenameError       10   The file could not be renamed.

   QFile::ResizeError       12   The file could not be resized.
   QFile::PermissionsError  13   The file could not be accessed.
   QFile::CopyError         14   The file could not be copied.

  enum QFile::Permission
  flags QFile::Permissions

   This enum is used by the permission() function to report the
   permissions and ownership of a file. The values may be OR-ed together
   to test multiple permissions and ownership values.

   Constant Value Description
   QFile::ReadOwner 0x4000 The file is readable by the owner of the file.
   QFile::WriteOwner 0x2000 The file is writable by the owner of the
   file.
   QFile::ExeOwner 0x1000 The file is executable by the owner of the
   file.
   QFile::ReadUser 0x0400 The file is readable by the user.
   QFile::WriteUser 0x0200 The file is writable by the user.
   QFile::ExeUser 0x0100 The file is executable by the user.
   QFile::ReadGroup 0x0040 The file is readable by the group.
   QFile::WriteGroup 0x0020 The file is writable by the group.
   QFile::ExeGroup 0x0010 The file is executable by the group.
   QFile::ReadOther 0x0004 The file is readable by anyone.
   QFile::WriteOther 0x0002 The file is writable by anyone.
   QFile::ExeOther 0x0001 The file is executable by anyone.

   Warning: Because of differences in the platforms supported by Qt, the
   semantics of ReadUser, WriteUser and ExeUser are platform-dependent:
   On Unix, the rights of the owner of the file are returned and on
   Windows the rights of the current user are returned. This behavior
   might change in a future Qt version.

   The Permissions type is a typedef for QFlags<Permission>. It stores an
   OR combination of Permission values.

  typedef QFile::PermissionSpec

   Use QFile::Permission instead.

Member Function Documentation

  QFile::QFile ( const QString & name )

   Constructs a new file object to represent the file with the given
   name.

  QFile::QFile ( QObject * parent )

   Constructs a new file object with the given parent.

  QFile::QFile ( const QString & name, QObject * parent )

   Constructs a new file object with the given parent to represent the
   file with the specified name.

  QFile::~QFile ()

   Destroys the file object, closing it if necessary.

  bool QFile::copy ( const QString & newName )

   Copies the file currently specified by fileName() to newName. Returns
   true if successful; otherwise returns false.

   The file is closed before it is copied.

   See also setFileName().

  bool QFile::copy ( const QString & fileName, const QString & newName )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Copies the file fileName to newName. Returns true if successful;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also rename().

  QString QFile::decodeName ( const QByteArray & localFileName )   [static]

   This does the reverse of QFile::encodeName() using localFileName.

   See also setDecodingFunction() and encodeName().

  QString QFile::decodeName ( const char * localFileName )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the Unicode version of the given localFileName. See
   encodeName() for details.

  QByteArray QFile::encodeName ( const QString & fileName )   [static]

   By default, this function converts fileName to the local 8-bit
   encoding determined by the user's locale. This is sufficient for file
   names that the user chooses. File names hard-coded into the
   application should only use 7-bit ASCII filename characters.

   See also decodeName() and setEncodingFunction().

  FileError QFile::error () const

   Returns the file error status.

   The I/O device status returns an error code. For example, if open()
   returns false, or a read/write operation returns -1, this function can
   be called to find out the reason why the operation failed.

   See also unsetError().

  bool QFile::exists ( const QString & fileName )   [static]

   Returns true if the file specified by fileName exists; otherwise
   returns false.

  bool QFile::exists () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns true if the file specified by fileName() exists; otherwise
   returns false.

   See also fileName() and setFileName().

  QString QFile::fileName () const

   Returns the name set by setFileName().

   See also setFileName() and QFileInfo::fileName().

  bool QFile::flush ()

   Flushes any buffered data to the file.

  int QFile::handle () const

   Returns the file handle of the file.

   This is a small positive integer, suitable for use with C library
   functions such as fdopen() and fcntl(). On systems that use file
   descriptors for sockets (i.e. Unix systems, but not Windows) the
   handle can be used with QSocketNotifier as well.

   If the file is not open, or there is an error, handle() returns -1.

   See also QSocketNotifier.

  bool QFile::isSequential () const   [virtual]

   Returns true if the file can only be manipulated sequentially;
   otherwise returns false.

   Most files support random-access, but some special files may not.

   Reimplemented from QIODevice.

   See also QIODevice::isSequential().

  bool QFile::link ( const QString & newName )

   Creates a link from the file currently specified by fileName() to
   newName. What a link is depends on the underlying filesystem (be it a
   shortcut on Windows or a symbolic link on Unix). Returns true if
   successful; otherwise returns false.

   See also setFileName().

  bool QFile::link ( const QString & oldName, const QString & newName )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Creates a link from oldName to newName. What a link is depends on the
   underlying filesystem (be it a shortcut on Windows or a symbolic link
   on Unix). Returns true if successful; otherwise returns false.

   See also link().

  bool QFile::open ( OpenMode mode )   [virtual]

   Opens the file using OpenMode mode.

   The mode must be QIODevice::ReadOnly, QIODevice::WriteOnly, or
   QIODevice::ReadWrite. It may also have additional flags, such as
   QIODevice::Text and QIODevice::Unbuffered.

   Reimplemented from QIODevice.

   See also QIODevice::OpenMode.

  bool QFile::open ( FILE * fh, OpenMode mode )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Opens the existing file handle fh in the given mode. Returns true if
   successful; otherwise returns false.

   Example:
    #include <stdio.h>

    void printError(const char* msg)
    {
        QFile file;
        file.open(stderr, QIODevice::WriteOnly);
        file.write(msg, qstrlen(msg));        // write to stderr
        file.close();
    }

   When a QFile is opened using this function, close() does not actually
   close the file, but only flushes it.

   Warning: If fh is stdin, stdout, or stderr, you may not be able to
   seek(). See QIODevice::isSequentialAccess() for more information.

   See also close().

  bool QFile::open ( int fd, OpenMode mode )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Opens the existing file descripter fd in the given mode. Returns true
   if successful; otherwise returns false.

   When a QFile is opened using this function, close() does not actually
   close the file.

   The QFile that is opened using this function is automatically set to
   be in raw mode; this means that the file input/output functions are
   slow. If you run into performance issues, you should try to use one of
   the other open functions.

   Warning: If fd is 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), or 2 (stderr), you may not be
   able to seek(). size() is set to LLONG_MAX (in <climits>).

   See also close().

  Permissions QFile::permissions () const

   Returns the complete OR-ed together combination of QFile::Permission
   for the file.

   See also setPermissions() and setFileName().

  Permissions QFile::permissions ( const QString & fileName )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the complete OR-ed together combination of QFile::Permission
   for fileName.

  QString QFile::readLink ( const QString & fileName )   [static]

   Returns the filename referred to by the symlink (or shortcut on
   Windows) specified by fileName, or returns an empty string if the
   fileName does not correspond to a symbolic link.

   This name may not represent an existing file; it is only a string.
   QFile::exists() returns true if the symlink points to an existing
   file.

  QString QFile::readLink () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the name a symlink (or shortcut on Windows) points to, or a an
   empty string if the object isn't a symbolic link.

   This name may not represent an existing file; it is only a string.
   QFie::exists() returns true if the symlink points to an existing file.

   See also fileName() and setFileName().

  bool QFile::remove ()

   Removes the file specified by fileName(). Returns true if successful;
   otherwise returns false.

   The file is closed before it is removed.

   See also setFileName().

  bool QFile::remove ( const QString & fileName )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Removes the file specified by the fileName given.

   Returns true if successful; otherwise returns false.

   See also remove().

  bool QFile::rename ( const QString & newName )

   Renames the file currently specified by fileName() to newName. Returns
   true if successful; otherwise returns false.

   The file is closed before it is renamed.

   See also setFileName().

  bool QFile::rename ( const QString & oldName, const QString & newName )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Renames the file oldName to newName. Returns true if successful;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also rename().

  bool QFile::resize ( qint64 sz )

   Sets the file size (in bytes) sz. Returns true if the file if the
   resize succeeds; false otherwise. If sz is larger than the file
   currently is the new bytes will be set to 0, if sz is smaller the file
   is simply truncated.

   See also size() and setFileName().

  bool QFile::resize ( const QString & fileName, qint64 sz )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets fileName to size (in bytes) sz. Returns true if the file if the
   resize succeeds; false otherwise. If sz is larger than fileName
   currently is the new bytes will be set to 0, if sz is smaller the file
   is simply truncated.

   See also resize().

  void QFile::setDecodingFunction ( DecoderFn function )   [static]

   Sets the function for decoding 8-bit file names. The default uses the
   locale-specific 8-bit encoding.

   Warning: This function is not reentrant.

   See also setEncodingFunction() and decodeName().

  void QFile::setEncodingFunction ( EncoderFn function )   [static]

   Sets the function for encoding Unicode file names. The default encodes
   in the locale-specific 8-bit encoding.

   Warning: This function is not reentrant.

   See also encodeName() and setDecodingFunction().

  void QFile::setFileName ( const QString & name )

   Sets the name of the file. The name can have no path, a relative path,
   or an absolute absolute path.

   Do not call this function if the file has already been opened.

   If the file name has no path or a relative path, the path used will be
   the application's current directory path at the time of the open()
   call.

   Example:
    QFile file;
    QDir::setCurrent("/tmp");
    file.setFileName("readme.txt");
    QDir::setCurrent("/home");
    file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);      // opens "/home/readme.txt" under Unix

   Note that the directory separator "/" works for all operating systems
   supported by Qt.

   See also fileName(), QFileInfo, and QDir.

  bool QFile::setPermissions ( Permissions permissions )

   Sets the permissions for the file to permissions.

   See also permissions() and setFileName().

  bool QFile::setPermissions ( const QString & fileName, Permissions
  permissions )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the permissions for fileName file to permissions.

  void QFile::unsetError ()

   Sets the file's error to QFile::NoError.

   See also error().
