Detailed Description

   The QModelIndex class is used to locate data in a data model.

   This class is used as an index into item models derived from
   QAbstractItemModel. The index is used by item views, delegates, and
   selection models to locate an item in the model. QModelIndex objects
   are created by the model.

   Model indexes contain all the information required to specify the
   items they refer to in a model. Indexes are located in a row and a
   column, and they may have a parent index; use row(), column(), and
   parent() to obtain this information. Top-level items in a model are
   represented by model indexes that do not have a parent index - in this
   case, parent() will return an invalid model index that is equivalent
   to an index constructed with the zero argument form of the
   QModelIndex() constructor.

   To obtain a model index that refers to an item in a model, call
   QAbstractItemModel::index() with the required row and column values,
   and the model index of the parent. When referring to top-level items
   in a model, supply QModelIndex() as the parent index.

   The model() function returns the model that the index references as a
   QAbstractItemModel. The child() function is used to examine the items
   held beneath the index in the model. The sibling() function allows you
   to traverse items in the model on the same level as the index.

   Model indexes can become invalid over time so they should be used
   immediately and then discarded. If you need to keep a model index over
   time use a QPersistentModelIndex.

   See also Model/View Programming, QPersistentModelIndex, and
   QAbstractItemModel.

Member Function Documentation

  QModelIndex::QModelIndex ()

   Creates a new empty model index. This type of model index is used to
   indicate that the position in the model is invalid.

   See also isValid() and QAbstractItemModel.

  QModelIndex::QModelIndex ( const QModelIndex & other )

   Creates a new model index that is a copy of the other model index.

  QModelIndex::~QModelIndex ()

   Destroys the model index.

  QModelIndex QModelIndex::child ( int row, int column ) const

   Returns the child of the model index that is stored in the given row
   and column.

   See also parent() and sibling().

  int QModelIndex::column () const

   Returns the column this model index refers to.

  qint64 QModelIndex::internalId () const

   Returns a qint64 used by the model to associate the index with the
   internal data structure.

  void * QModelIndex::internalPointer () const

   Returns a void * pointer used by the model to associate the index with
   the internal data structure.

  bool QModelIndex::isValid () const

   Returns true if this model index is valid; otherwise returns false.

  const QAbstractItemModel * QModelIndex::model () const

   Returns a pointer to the model containing the item that this index
   refers to.

  QModelIndex QModelIndex::parent () const

   Return the parent of the model index, or QModelIndex() if it has no
   parent.

   See also child(), sibling(), and model().

  int QModelIndex::row () const

   Returns the row this model index refers to.

  QModelIndex QModelIndex::sibling ( int row, int column ) const

   Returns the sibling at row and column or an invalid QModelIndex if
   there is no sibling at this position.

   See also parent() and child().

  bool QModelIndex::operator!= ( const QModelIndex & other ) const

   Returns true if this model index does not refer to the same location
   as the other model index; otherwise returns false.

  bool QModelIndex::operator== ( const QModelIndex & other ) const

   Returns true if this model index refers to the same location as the
   other model index; otherwise returns false.
