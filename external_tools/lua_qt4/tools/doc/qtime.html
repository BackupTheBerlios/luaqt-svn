Detailed Description

   The QTime class provides clock time functions.

   A QTime object contains a clock time, i.e. the number of hours,
   minutes, seconds, and milliseconds since midnight. It can read the
   current time from the system clock and measure a span of elapsed time.
   It provides functions for comparing times and for manipulating a time
   by adding a number of (milli)seconds.

   QTime uses the 24-hour clock format; it has no concept of AM/PM. It
   operates in local time; it knows nothing about time zones or daylight
   savings time.

   A QTime object is typically created either by giving the number of
   hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds explicitly, or by using the
   static function currentTime(), which creates a QTime object that
   contains the system's clock time. Note that the accuracy depends on
   the accuracy of the underlying operating system; not all systems
   provide 1-millisecond accuracy.

   The hour(), minute(), second(), and msec() functions provide access to
   the number of hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds of the time.
   The same information is provided in textual format by the toString()
   function.

   QTime provides a full set of operators to compare two QTime objects.
   One time is considered smaller than another if it is earlier than the
   other.

   The time a given number of seconds or milliseconds later than a given
   time can be found using the addSecs() or addMSecs() functions.
   Correspondingly, the number of (milli)seconds between two times can be
   found using the secsTo() or msecsTo() functions.

   QTime can be used to measure a span of elapsed time using the start(),
   restart(), and elapsed() functions.

   See also QDate and QDateTime.

Member Function Documentation

  QTime::QTime ()

   Constructs the time 0 hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds, i.e.
   00:00:00.000 (midnight). This is a valid time.

   See also isValid().

  QTime::QTime ( int h, int m, int s = 0, int ms = 0 )

   Constructs a time with hour h, minute m, seconds s and milliseconds
   ms.

   h must be in the range 0 to 23, m and s must be in the range 0 to 59,
   and ms must be in the range 0 to 999.

   See also isValid().

  QTime QTime::addMSecs ( int ms ) const

   Returns a QTime object containing a time ms milliseconds later than
   the time of this object (or earlier if ms is negative).

   Note that the time will wrap if it passes midnight. See addSecs() for
   an example.

   See also addSecs() and msecsTo().

  QTime QTime::addSecs ( int nsecs ) const

   Returns a QTime object containing a time nsecs seconds later than the
   time of this object (or earlier if nsecs is negative).

   Note that the time will wrap if it passes midnight.

   Example:
    QTime n(14, 0, 0);                // n == 14:00:00
    QTime t;
    t = n.addSecs(70);                // t == 14:01:10
    t = n.addSecs(-70);               // t == 13:58:50
    t = n.addSecs(10 * 60 * 60 + 5);  // t == 00:00:05
    t = n.addSecs(-15 * 60 * 60);     // t == 23:00:00

   See also addMSecs(), secsTo(), and QDateTime::addSecs().

  QTime QTime::currentTime ()   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the current time as reported by the system clock.

   Note that the accuracy depends on the accuracy of the underlying
   operating system; not all systems provide 1-millisecond accuracy.

  int QTime::elapsed () const

   Returns the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the last
   time start() or restart() was called.

   Note that the counter wraps to zero 24 hours after the last call to
   start() or restart.

   Note that the accuracy depends on the accuracy of the underlying
   operating system; not all systems provide 1-millisecond accuracy.

   Warning: If the system's clock setting has been changed since the last
   time start() or restart() was called, the result is undefined. This
   can happen when daylight savings time is turned on or off.

   See also start() and restart().

  QTime QTime::fromString ( const QString & string, Qt::DateFormat format =
  Qt::TextDate )   [static]

   Returns the time represented in the string as a QTime using the format
   given, or an invalid time if this is not possible.

   Warning: Note that Qt::LocalDate cannot be used here.

  QTime QTime::fromString ( const QString & string, const QString & format )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the QTime represented by the string, using the format given,
   or an invalid time if the string cannot be parsed.

   These expressions may be used for the format:

                             Expression Output
       h the hour without a leading zero (0 to 23 or 1 to 12 if AM/PM
                                  display)
       hh the hour with a leading zero (00 to 23 or 01 to 12 if AM/PM
                                  display)
               m the minute without a leading zero (0 to 59)
                mm the minute with a leading zero (00 to 59)
               s the second whithout a leading zero (0 to 59)
               ss the second whith a leading zero (00 to 59)
            z the milliseconds without leading zeroes (0 to 999)
           zzz the milliseconds with leading zeroes (000 to 999)
       AP interpret as an AM/PM time. AP must be either "AM" or "PM".
       ap Interpret as an AM/PM time. ap must be either "am" or "pm".

   All other input characters will be treated as text. Any sequence of
   characters that are enclosed in single quotes will also be treated as
   text and not be used as an expression.
    QTime time = QTime::fromString("1mm12car00", "m'mm'hcarss");
    // time is 12:01.00

   If the format is not satisfied an invalid QTime is returned.
   Expressions that do not expect leading zeroes to be given (h, m, s and
   z) are greedy. This means that they will use two digits even if this
   puts them outside the range of accepted values and leaves too few
   digits for other sections. For example, the following string could
   have meant 00:07:10, but the m will grab two digits, resulting in an
   invalid time:
    QTime time = QTime::fromString("00:710", "hh:ms"); // invalid

   Any field that is not represented in the format will be set to zero.
   For example:
    QTime time = QTime::fromString("1.30", "m.s");
    // time is 00:01:30.000

   QDateTime::toString() QTime::toString()

   See also QDateTime::fromString(), QDate::fromString(), and
   QDate::toString().

  int QTime::hour () const

   Returns the hour part (0 to 23) of the time.

   See also minute(), second(), and msec().

  bool QTime::isNull () const

   Returns true if the time is equal to 00:00:00.000; otherwise returns
   false. A null time is valid.

   See also isValid().

  bool QTime::isValid () const

   Returns true if the time is valid; otherwise returns false. For
   example, the time 23:30:55.746 is valid, but 24:12:30 is invalid.

   See also isNull().

  bool QTime::isValid ( int h, int m, int s, int ms = 0 )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns true if the specified time is valid; otherwise returns false.

   The time is valid if h is in the range 0 to 23, m and s are in the
   range 0 to 59, and ms is in the range 0 to 999.

   Example:
    QTime::isValid(21, 10, 30); // returns true
    QTime::isValid(22, 5,  62); // returns false

  int QTime::minute () const

   Returns the minute part (0 to 59) of the time.

   See also hour(), second(), and msec().

  int QTime::msec () const

   Returns the millisecond part (0 to 999) of the time.

   See also hour(), minute(), and second().

  int QTime::msecsTo ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns the number of milliseconds from this time to t. If t is
   earlier than this time, the number of milliseconds returned is
   negative.

   Because QTime measures time within a day and there are 86400 seconds
   in a day, the result is always between -86400000 and 86400000 msec.

   See also secsTo() and addMSecs().

  int QTime::restart ()

   Sets this time to the current time and returns the number of
   milliseconds that have elapsed since the last time start() or
   restart() was called.

   This function is guaranteed to be atomic and is thus very handy for
   repeated measurements. Call start() to start the first measurement,
   and restart() for each later measurement.

   Note that the counter wraps to zero 24 hours after the last call to
   start() or restart().

   Warning: If the system's clock setting has been changed since the last
   time start() or restart() was called, the result is undefined. This
   can happen when daylight savings time is turned on or off.

   See also start(), elapsed(), and currentTime().

  int QTime::second () const

   Returns the second part (0 to 59) of the time.

   See also hour(), minute(), and msec().

  int QTime::secsTo ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns the number of seconds from this time to t. If t is earlier
   than this time, the number of seconds returned is negative.

   Because QTime measures time within a day and there are 86400 seconds
   in a day, the result is always between -86400 and 86400.

   See also addSecs() and QDateTime::secsTo().

  bool QTime::setHMS ( int h, int m, int s, int ms = 0 )

   Sets the time to hour h, minute m, seconds s and milliseconds ms.

   h must be in the range 0 to 23, m and s must be in the range 0 to 59,
   and ms must be in the range 0 to 999. Returns true if the set time is
   valid; otherwise returns false.

   See also isValid().

  void QTime::start ()

   Sets this time to the current time. This is practical for timing:
    QTime t;
    t.start();
    some_lengthy_task();
    qDebug("Time elapsed: %d ms", t.elapsed());

   See also restart(), elapsed(), and currentTime().

  QString QTime::toString ( const QString & format ) const

   Returns the time as a string. The format parameter determines the
   format of the result string.

   These expressions may be used:

                             Expression Output
       h the hour without a leading zero (0 to 23 or 1 to 12 if AM/PM
                                  display)
       hh the hour with a leading zero (00 to 23 or 01 to 12 if AM/PM
                                  display)
               m the minute without a leading zero (0 to 59)
                mm the minute with a leading zero (00 to 59)
               s the second whithout a leading zero (0 to 59)
               ss the second whith a leading zero (00 to 59)
            z the milliseconds without leading zeroes (0 to 999)
           zzz the milliseconds with leading zeroes (000 to 999)
     AP use AM/PM display. AP will be replaced by either "AM" or "PM".
     ap use am/pm display. ap will be replaced by either "am" or "pm".

   All other input characters will be ignored. Any sequence of characters
   that are enclosed in singlequotes will be treated as text and not be
   used as an expression.

   Example format strings (assuming that the QTime is 14:13:09.042)

                            Format       Result
                         hh:mm:ss.zzz 14:13:09.042
                           h:m:s ap    2:13:9 pm

   If the datetime is invalid, an empty string will be returned.

   See also QDate::toString() and QDateTime::toString().

  QString QTime::toString ( Qt::DateFormat f = Qt::TextDate ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the time as a string. Milliseconds are not included. The f
   parameter determines the format of the string.

   If f is Qt::TextDate, the string format is HH:MM:SS; e.g. 1 second
   before midnight would be "23:59:59".

   If f is Qt::ISODate, the string format corresponds to the ISO 8601
   extended specification for representations of dates, which is also
   HH:MM:SS.

   If f is Qt::LocalDate, the string format depends on the locale
   settings of the system.

   If the datetime is invalid, an empty string will be returned.

  bool QTime::operator!= ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns true if this time is different from t; otherwise returns
   false.

  bool QTime::operator< ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns true if this time is earlier than t; otherwise returns false.

  bool QTime::operator<= ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns true if this time is earlier than or equal to t; otherwise
   returns false.

  bool QTime::operator== ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns true if this time is equal to t; otherwise returns false.

  bool QTime::operator> ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns true if this time is later than t; otherwise returns false.

  bool QTime::operator>= ( const QTime & t ) const

   Returns true if this time is later than or equal to t; otherwise
   returns false.
