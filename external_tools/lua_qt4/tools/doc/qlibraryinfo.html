Detailed Description

   The QLibraryInfo class provides information about the Qt library.

   Many pieces of information are established when Qt is configured.
   Installation paths, license information, and even a unique build key.
   This class provides an abstraction for accessing this information.

                           Function Return value
         buildKey() A string that identifies the Qt version and the
    configuration. This key is used to ensure that plugins link against
                 the same version of Qt as the application.
    location() The path to a certain Qt component (e.g., documentation,
                               header files).
           licensee(), licensedProducts() Licensing information.

Member Function Documentation

  QString QLibraryInfo::buildKey ()   [static]

   Returns a unique key identifying this build of Qt and its
   configurations. This key is not globally unique, rather only useful
   for establishing of two configurations are compatible. This can be
   used to compare with the QT_BUILD_KEY preprocessor symbol.

   See also location().

  QString QLibraryInfo::licensedProducts ()   [static]

   Returns the products that the license for this build of Qt has access
   to.

   See also licensee().

  QString QLibraryInfo::licensee ()   [static]

   Returns the person to whom this build of Qt is licensed.

   See also licensedProducts().

  QString QLibraryInfo::location ( LibraryLocation loc )   [static]

   Returns the location specified by loc.
