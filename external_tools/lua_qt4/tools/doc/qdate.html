Detailed Description

   The QDate class provides date functions.

   A QDate object contains a calendar date, i.e. year, month, and day
   numbers, in the modern Western (Gregorian) calendar. It can read the
   current date from the system clock. It provides functions for
   comparing dates, and for manipulating dates. For example, it is
   possible to add and subtract days, months, and years to dates.

   A QDate object is typically created either by giving the year, month,
   and day numbers explicitly, or by using the static function
   currentDate() that creates a QDate object containing the system
   clock's date. An explicit date can also be set using setYMD(). The
   fromString() function returns a QDate given a string and a date format
   which is used to interpret the date within the string.

   The year(), month(), and day() functions provide access to the year,
   month, and day numbers. Also, dayOfWeek() and dayOfYear() functions
   are provided. The same information is provided in textual format by
   the toString(), shortDayName(), longDayName(), shortMonthName(), and
   longMonthName() functions.

   QDate provides a full set of operators to compare two QDate objects
   where smaller means earlier, and larger means later.

   You can increment (or decrement) a date by a given number of days
   using addDays(). Similarly you can use addMonths() and addYears(). The
   daysTo() function returns the number of days between two dates.

   The daysInMonth() and daysInYear() functions return how many days
   there are in this date's month and year, respectively. The
   isLeapYear() function indicates whether this date is in a leap year.

   Note that QDate should not be used for date calculations for dates
   prior to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. This calendar was
   adopted by England from the 14 September 1752 (hence this is the
   earliest valid QDate), and subsequently by most other Western
   countries, by 1923.

   The latest valid year within this scheme is the year 8000.

   See also QTime, QDateTime, QDateEdit, and QDateTimeEdit.

Member Function Documentation

  QDate::QDate ()

   Constructs a null date. Null dates are invalid.

   See also isNull() and isValid().

  QDate::QDate ( int y, int m, int d )

   Constructs a date with year y, month m and day d.

   y must be in the range 1752 to 8000, m must be in the range 1 to 12,
   and d must be in the range 1 to 31.

   Warning: If y is in the range 0 to 99, it is interpreted as a year in
   the range 1900 to 1999.

   See also isValid().

  QDate QDate::addDays ( int ndays ) const

   Returns a QDate object containing a date ndays later than the date of
   this object (or earlier if ndays is negative).

   See also addMonths(), addYears(), and daysTo().

  QDate QDate::addMonths ( int nmonths ) const

   Returns a QDate object containing a date nmonths later than the date
   of this object (or earlier if nmonths is negative).

   See also addDays() and addYears().

  QDate QDate::addYears ( int nyears ) const

   Returns a QDate object containing a date nyears later than the date of
   this object (or earlier if nyears is negative).

   See also addDays() and addMonths().

  QDate QDate::currentDate ()   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the current date, as reported by the system clock.

   See also QTime::currentTime() and QDateTime::currentDateTime().

  int QDate::day () const

   Returns the day of the month (1 to 31) of this date.

   See also year(), month(), and dayOfWeek().

  int QDate::dayOfWeek () const

   Returns the weekday for this date.

   See also day(), dayOfYear(), and Qt::DayOfWeek.

  int QDate::dayOfYear () const

   Returns the day of the year (1 to 365) for this date.

   See also day() and dayOfWeek().

  int QDate::daysInMonth () const

   Returns the number of days in the month (28 to 31) for this date.

   See also day() and daysInYear().

  int QDate::daysInYear () const

   Returns the number of days in the year (365 or 366) for this date.

   See also day() and daysInMonth().

  int QDate::daysTo ( const QDate & d ) const

   Returns the number of days from this date to d (which is negative if d
   is earlier than this date).

   Example:
    QDate d1(1995, 5, 17);  // May 17, 1995
    QDate d2(1995, 5, 20);  // May 20, 1995
    d1.daysTo(d2);          // returns 3
    d2.daysTo(d1);          // returns -3

   See also addDays().

  QDate QDate::fromJulianDay ( int jd )   [static]

   Converts the Julian day jd to a QDate.

   See also toJulianDay().

  QDate QDate::fromString ( const QString & string, Qt::DateFormat format =
  Qt::TextDate )   [static]

   Returns the QDate represented by the string, using the format given,
   or an invalid date if the string cannot be parsed.

   Note for Qt::TextDate: It is recommended that you use the English
   short month names (e.g. "Jan"). Although localized month names can
   also be used, they depend on the user's locale settings.

   Warning: Qt::LocalDate cannot be used here.

  QDate QDate::fromString ( const QString & string, const QString & format )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the QDate represented by the string, using the format given,
   or an invalid date if the string cannot be parsed.

   These expressions may be used for the format:

                             Expression Output
           d The day as a number without a leading zero (1 to 31)
           dd The day as a number with a leading zero (01 to 31)
     ddd The abbreviated localized day name (e.g. 'Mon' to 'Sun'). Uses
                           QDate::shortDayName().
     dddd The long localized day name (e.g. 'Monday' to 'Sunday'). Uses
                           QDate::longDayName().
          M The month as a number without a leading zero (1 to 12)
          MM The month as a number with a leading zero (01 to 12)
    MMM The abbreviated localized month name (e.g. 'Jan' to 'Dec'). Uses
                          QDate::shortMonthName().
     MMMM The long localized month name (e.g. 'January' to 'December').
                        Uses QDate::longMonthName().
                 yy The year as two digit number (00 to 99)
             yyyy The year as four digit number (1752 to 8000)

   All other input characters will be treated as text. Any sequence of
   characters that are enclosed in single quotes will also be treated as
   text and will not be used as an expression. For example:
    QDate date = QDate::fromString("1MM12car2003", "d'MM'MMcaryyyy");
    // date is 1 December 2003

   If the format is not satisfied, an invalid QDate is returned. The
   expressions that don't expect leading zeroes (d, M) will be greedy.
   This means that they will use two digits even if this will put them
   outside the accepted range of values and leaves too few digits for
   other sections. For example, the following format string could have
   meant January 30 but the M will grab two digits, resulting in an
   invalid date:
    QDate date = QDate::fromString("130", "Md"); // invalid

   For any field that is not represented in the format the following
   defaults are used:

                           Field  Default value
                           Year  The current year
                           Month        1
                            Day         1

   The following examples demonstrate the default values:
    QDate::fromString("1.30", "M.d");           // January 30 in the current ye
ar
    QDate::fromString("20000110", "yyyyMMdd");  // January 10, 2000
    QDate::fromString("20000110", "yyyyMd");    // January 10, 2000

   See also QDateTime::fromString(), QTime::fromString(),
   QDate::toString(), QDateTime::toString(), and QTime::toString().

  bool QDate::isLeapYear ( int year )   [static]

   Returns true if the specified year is a leap year; otherwise returns
   false.

  bool QDate::isNull () const

   Returns true if the date is null; otherwise returns false. A null date
   is invalid.

   See also isValid().

  bool QDate::isValid () const

   Returns true if this date is valid; otherwise returns false.

   See also isNull().

  bool QDate::isValid ( int y, int m, int d )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns true if the specified date (year y, month m, and day d) is
   valid; otherwise returns false.

   Example:
    QDate::isValid(2002, 5, 17);  // true
    QDate::isValid(2002, 2, 30);  // false (Feb 30 does not exist)
    QDate::isValid(2004, 2, 29);  // true (2004 is a leap year)
    QDate::isValid(1202, 6, 6);   // false (1202 is pre-Gregorian)

   Warning: A y value in the range 00 to 99 is interpreted as 1900 to
   1999.

   See also isNull() and setYMD().

  QString QDate::longDayName ( int weekday )   [static]

   Returns the long name of the weekday using the following convention:

     * 5 = "May"
     * 6 = "June"
     * 7 = "July"
     * 8 = "August"
     * 9 = "September"
     * 10 = "October"

  int QDate::toJulianDay () const

   Converts the date to a Julian day.

   See also fromJulianDay().

  QString QDate::toString ( const QString & format ) const

   Returns the date as a string. The format parameter determines the
   format of the result string.

   These expressions may be used:

                             Expression Output
            d the day as number without a leading zero (1 to31)
            dd the day as number with a leading zero (01 to 31)
     ddd the abbreviated localized day name (e.g. 'Mon' to 'Sun'). Uses
                           QDate::shortDayName().
   dddd the long localized day name (e.g. 'Qt::Monday' to 'Qt::Sunday').
                         Uses QDate::longDayName().
            M the month as number without a leading zero (1-12)
             MM the month as number with a leading zero (01-12)
    MMM the abbreviated localized month name (e.g. 'Jan' to 'Dec'). Uses
                          QDate::shortMonthName().
     MMMM the long localized month name (e.g. 'January' to 'December').
                        Uses QDate::longMonthName().
                 yy the year as two digit number (00 to 99)
             yyyy the year as four digit number (1752 to 8000)

   All other input characters will be ignored. Any sequence of characters
   that are enclosed in singlequotes will be treated as text and not be
   used as an expression.

   Example format strings (assuming that the QDate is the 20 July 1969):

                         Format            Result
                       dd.MM.yyyy        20.07.1969
                      ddd MMMM d yy    Sun July 20 69
                    'The day is' dddd The day is Sunday

   If the datetime is invalid, an empty string will be returned.

   See also QDateTime::toString() and QTime::toString().

  QString QDate::toString ( Qt::DateFormat format = Qt::TextDate ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the date as a string. The format parameter determines the
   format of the string.

   If the format is Qt::TextDate, the string is formatted in the default
   way. QDate::shortDayName() and QDate::shortMonthName() are used to
   generate the string, so the day and month names will be localized
   names. An example of this formatting is "Sat May 20 1995".

   If the format is Qt::ISODate, the string format corresponds to the ISO
   8601 extended specification for representations of dates and times,
   taking the form YYYY-MM-DD, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month of
   the year (between 01 and 12), and DD is the day of the month between
   01 and 31.

   If the format is Qt::LocalDate, the string format depends on the
   locale settings of the system.

   If the datetime is invalid, an empty string will be returned.

   See also shortDayName() and shortMonthName().

  int QDate::weekNumber ( int * yearNumber = 0 ) const

   Returns the week number (1 to 53), and stores the year in *yearNumber
   unless yearNumber is null (the default).

   Returns 0 if the date is invalid.

   In accordance with ISO 8601, weeks start on Qt::Monday and the first
   Qt::Thursday of a year is always in week 1 of that year. Most years
   have 52 weeks, but some have 53.

   *yearNumber is not always the same as year(). For example, 1 January
   2000 has week number 52 in the year 1999, and 31 December 2002 has
   week number 1 in the year 2003.
