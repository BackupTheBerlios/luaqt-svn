Detailed Description

   The QValidator class provides validation of input text.

   The class itself is abstract. Two subclasses, QIntValidator and
   QDoubleValidator, provide basic numeric-range checking, and
   QRegExpValidator provides general checking using a custom regular
   expression.

   If the built-in validators aren't sufficient, you can subclass
   QValidator. The class has two virtual functions: validate() and
   fixup().

   validate() must be implemented by every subclass. It returns Invalid,
   Intermediate or Acceptable depending on whether its argument is valid
   (for the subclass's definition of valid).

   These three states require some explanation. An Invalid string is
   clearly invalid. Intermediate is less obvious: the concept of validity
   is difficult to apply when the string is incomplete (still being
   edited). QValidator defines Intermediate as the property of a string
   that is neither clearly invalid nor acceptable as a final result.
   Acceptable means that the string is acceptable as a final result. One
   might say that any string that is a plausible intermediate state
   during entry of an Acceptable string is Intermediate.

   Here are some examples:
     * For a line edit that accepts integers from 10 to 999 inclusive, 42
       and 123 are Acceptable, the empty string and 5 are Intermediate,
       and "asdf" and 1114 is Invalid.
     * For an editable combobox that accepts URLs, any well-formed URL is
       Acceptable, "http://www.trolltech.com/," is Intermediate (it might
       be a cut and paste action that accidentally took in a comma at the
       end), the empty string is Intermediate (the user might select and
       delete all of the text in preparation for entering a new URL) and
       "http:///./" is Invalid.
     * For a spin box that accepts lengths, "11cm" and "1in" are
       Acceptable, "11" and the empty string are Intermediate, and
       "http://www.trolltech.com" and "hour" are Invalid.

   fixup() is provided for validators that can repair some user errors.
   The default implementation does nothing. QLineEdit, for example, will
   call fixup() if the user presses Enter (or Return) and the content is
   not currently valid. This allows the fixup() function the opportunity
   of performing some magic to make an Invalid string Acceptable.

   QValidator is typically used with QLineEdit, QSpinBox and QComboBox.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QValidator::State

   This enum type defines the states in which a validated string can
   exist.

   Constant Value Description
   QValidator::Invalid 0 The string is clearly invalid.
   QValidator::Intermediate 1 The string is a plausible intermediate
   value during editing.
   QValidator::Acceptable   The string is acceptable as a final result;
   i.e. it is valid.

Member Function Documentation

  QValidator::QValidator ( QObject * parent )

   Sets up the validator. The parent parameter is passed on to the
   QObject constructor.

  QValidator::~QValidator ()

   Destroys the validator, freeing any storage and other resources used.

  void QValidator::fixup ( QString & input ) const   [virtual]

   This function attempts to change input to be valid according to this
   validator's rules. It need not result in a valid string: callers of
   this function must re-test afterwards; the default does nothing.

   Reimplementations of this function can change input even if they do
   not produce a valid string. For example, an ISBN validator might want
   to delete every character except digits and "-", even if the result is
   still not a valid ISBN; a surname validator might want to remove
   whitespace from the start and end of the string, even if the resulting
   string is not in the list of accepted surnames.

  State QValidator::validate ( QString & input, int & pos ) const   [pure
  virtual]

   This virtual function returns Invalid if input is invalid according to
   this validator's rules, Intermediate if it is likely that a little
   more editing will make the input acceptable (e.g. the user types "4"
   into a widget which accepts integers between 10 and 99), and
   Acceptable if the input is valid.

   The function can change both input and pos (the cursor position) if
   required.
