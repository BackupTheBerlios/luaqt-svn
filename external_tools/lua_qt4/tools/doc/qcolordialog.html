Detailed Description

   The QColorDialog class provides a dialog widget for specifying colors.

   The color dialog's function is to allow users to choose colors. For
   example, you might use this in a drawing program to allow the user to
   set the brush color.

   The static functions provide modal color dialogs.

   The static getColor() function shows the dialog, and allows the user
   to specify a color. The getRgba() function does the same, but also
   allows the user to specify a color with an alpha channel
   (transparency) value.

   The user can store customCount() different custom colors. The custom
   colors are shared by all color dialogs, and remembered during the
   execution of the program. Use setCustomColor() to set the custom
   colors, and use customColor() to get them.

   Additional widgets that allow users to pick colors are available as Qt
   Solutions.

   The Standard Dialogs example shows how to use QColorDialog as well as
   other built-in Qt dialogs.

Member Function Documentation

  QRgb QColorDialog::customColor ( int i )   [static]

   Returns custom color number i as a QRgb value.

  int QColorDialog::customCount ()   [static]

   Returns the number of custom colors supported by QColorDialog. All
   color dialogs share the same custom colors.

  QColor QColorDialog::getColor ( const QColor & initial = Qt::white, QWidget *
  parent = 0 )   [static]

   Pops up a modal color dialog, lets the user choose a color, and
   returns that color. The color is initially set to initial. The dialog
   is a child of parent. It returns an invalid (see QColor::isValid())
   color if the user cancels the dialog. All colors allocated by the
   dialog will be deallocated before this function returns.

  QRgb QColorDialog::getRgba ( QRgb initial, bool * ok = 0, QWidget * parent =
  0 )   [static]

   Pops up a modal color dialog to allow the user to choose a color and
   an alpha channel (transparency) value. The color+alpha is initially
   set to initial. The dialog is a child of parent.

   If ok is non-null, *a ok is set to true if the user clicked OK, and to
   false if the user clicked Cancel.

   If the user clicks Cancel, the initial value is returned.

  void QColorDialog::setCustomColor ( int number, QRgb color )   [static]

   Sets the custom color number to the QRgb color value.

  void QColorDialog::setStandardColor ( int number, QRgb color )   [static]

   Sets the standard color number to the QRgb color value given.
