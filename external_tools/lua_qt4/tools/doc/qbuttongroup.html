Detailed Description

   The QButtonGroup class provides a container to organize groups of
   button widgets.

   QButtonGroup provides an abstract container into which button widgets
   can be placed. It does not provide a visual representation of this
   container (see QGroupBox for a container widget), but instead manages
   the states of each of the buttons in the group.

   An exclusive button group switches off all checkable (toggle) buttons
   except the one that was clicked. By default, a button group is
   exclusive. The buttons in a button group are usually checkable
   QPushButton's, QCheckBoxes (normally for non-exclusive button groups),
   or QRadioButtons.

   A button is added to the group with addButton(). It can be removed
   from the group with removeButton(). If the group is exclusive, the
   currently checked button is available as checkedButton(). If a button
   is clicked the buttonClicked() signal is emitted. For a checkable
   button in an exclusive group this means that the button was checked.
   The list of buttons in the group is returned by buttons().

   See also QGroupBox, QPushButton, QCheckBox, and QRadioButton.

Property Documentation

  exclusive : bool

   This property holds whether the button group is exclusive.

   If this property is true, then the buttons in the group are checked
   (toggled), and to untoggle a button you must click on another button
   in the group. The default value is true.

   Access functions:
     * bool exclusive () const
     * void setExclusive ( bool )
