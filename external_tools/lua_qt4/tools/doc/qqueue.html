Detailed Description

   The QQueue class is a generic container that provides a queue.

   QQueue<T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It implements a
   queue data structure for items of a same type.

   A queue is a first in, first out (FIFO) structure. Items are added to
   the tail of the queue using enqueue() and retrieved from the head
   using dequeue(). The head() function provides access to the head item
   without removing it.

   Example:
    QQueue<int> queue;
    queue.enqueue(1);
    queue.enqueue(2);
    queue.enqueue(3);
    while (!queue.isEmpty())
        cout << queue.dequeue() << endl;

   The example will output 1, 2, 3 in that order.

   QQueue inherits from QList. All of QList's functionality also applies
   to QQueue. For example, you can use isEmpty() to test whether the
   queue is empty, and you can traverse a QQueue using QList's iterator
   classes (for example, QListIterator). But in addition, QQueue provides
   three convenience functions that make it easy to implement FIFO
   semantics: enqueue(), dequeue(), and head().

   QQueue's value type must be an assignable data type. This covers most
   data types that are commonly used, but the compiler won't let you, for
   example, store a QWidget as a value; instead, store a QWidget *.

   See also QList and QStack.

Member Function Documentation

  QQueue::QQueue ()

   Constructs an empty queue.

  QQueue::~QQueue ()

   Destroys the queue. References to the values in the queue, and all
   iterators over this queue, become invalid.

  T QQueue::dequeue ()

   Removes the head item in the queue and returns it. This function
   assumes that the queue isn't empty.

   This is the same as QList::takeFirst().

   See also head(), enqueue(), and isEmpty().

  void QQueue::enqueue ( const T & t )

   Adds value t to the tail of the queue.

   This is the same as QList::append().

   See also dequeue() and head().

  T & QQueue::head ()

   Returns a reference to the queue's head item. This function assumes
   that the queue isn't empty.

   This is the same as QList::first().

   See also dequeue(), enqueue(), and isEmpty().

  const T & QQueue::head () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.
