Detailed Description

   The QMap class is a template class that provides a skip-list-based
   dictionary.

   QMap<Key, T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It stores (key,
   value) pairs and provides fast lookup of the value associated with a
   key.

   QMap and QHash provide very similar functionality. The differences
   are:
     * QHash provides faster lookups than QMap.
     * When iterating over a QHash, the items are arbitrarily ordered.
       With QMap, the items are always sorted by key.
     * The key type of a QHash must provide operator==() and a global
       qHash(Key) function. The key type of a QMap must provide
       operator<().

   Here's an example QMap with QString keys and int values:
    QMap<QString, int> map;

   To insert a (key, value) pair into the map, you can use operator[]():
    map["one"] = 1;
    map["three"] = 3;
    map["seven"] = 7;

   This inserts the following three (key, value) pairs into the QMap:
   ("one", 1), ("three", 3), and ("seven", 7). Another way to insert
   items into the map is to use insert():
    map.insert("twelve", 12);

   To look up a value, use operator[]() or value():
    int num1 = map["thirteen"];
    int num2 = map.value("thirteen");

   If there is no item with the specified key in the map, these functions
   return a default-constructed value.

   If you want to check whether the map contains a certain key, use
   contains():
    int timeout = 30;
    if (map.contains("TIMEOUT"))
        timeout = map.value("TIMEOUT");

   There is also a value() overload that uses its second argument as a
   default value if there is no item with the specified key:
    int timeout = map.value("TIMEOUT", 30);

   In general, we recommend that you use contains() and value() rather
   than operator[]() for looking up a key in a map. The reason is that
   operator[]() silently inserts an item into the map if no item exists
   with the same key (unless the map is const). For example, the
   following code snippet will create 1000 items in memory:
    // WRONG
    QMap<int, QWidget *> map;
    ...
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        if (map[i] == okButton)
            cout << "Found button at index " << i << endl;
    }

   To avoid this problem, replace map[i] with map.value(i) in the code
   above.

   If you want to navigate through all the (key, value) pairs stored in a
   QMap, you can use an iterator. QMap provides both Java-style iterators
   (QMapIterator and QMutableMapIterator) and STL-style iterators
   (QMap::const_iterator and QMap::iterator). Here's how to iterate over
   a QMap<QString, int> using a Java-style iterator:
    QMapIterator<QString, int> i(map);
    while (i.hasNext()) {
        i.next();
        cout << i.key() << ": " << i.value() << endl;
    }

   Here's the same code, but using an STL-style iterator this time:
    QMap<QString, int>::const_iterator i = map.constBegin();
    while (i != map.constEnd()) {
        cout << i.key() << ": " << i.value() << endl;
        ++i;
    }

   The items are traversed in ascending key order.

   Normally, a QMap allows only one value per key. If you call insert()
   with a key that already exists in the QMap, the previous value will be
   erased. For example:
    map.insert("plenty", 100);
    map.insert("plenty", 2000);
    // map.value("plenty") == 2000

   However, you can store multiple values per key by using insertMulti()
   instead of insert() (or using the convenience subclass QMultiMap). If
   you want to retrieve all the values for a single key, you can use
   values(const Key &key), which returns a QList<T>:
    QList<int> values = map.values("plenty");
    for (int i = 0; i < values.size(); ++i)
        cout << values.at(i) << endl;

   The items that share the same key are available from most recently to
   least recently inserted. Another approach is to call find() to get the
   STL-style iterator for the first item with a key and iterate from
   there:
    QMap<QString, int>::iterator i = map.find("plenty");
    while (i != map.end() && i.key() == "plenty") {
        cout << i.value() << endl;
        ++i;
    }

   If you only need to extract the values from a map (not the keys), you
   can also use foreach:
    QMap<QString, int> map;
    ...
    foreach (int value, map)
        cout << value << endl;

   Items can be removed from the map in several ways. One way is to call
   remove(); this will remove any item with the given key. Another way is
   to use QMutableMapIterator::remove(). In addition, you can clear the
   entire map using clear().

   QMap's key and value data types must be assignable data types. This
   covers most data types you are likely to encounter, but the compiler
   won't let you, for example, store a QWidget as a value; instead, store
   a QWidget *. In addition, QMap's key type must provide operator<().
   QMap uses it to keep its items sorted, and assumes that two keys x and
   y are equal if neither x < y nor y < x is true.

   Example:
    #ifndef EMPLOYEE_H
    #define EMPLOYEE_H

    class Employee
    {
    public:
        Employee() {}
        Employee(const QString &name, const QDate &dateOfBirth);
        ...

    private:
        QString myName;
        QDate myDateOfBirth;
    };

    inline bool operator<(const Employee &e1, const Employee &e2)
    {
        if (e1.name() != e2.name())
            return e1.name() < e2.name();
        return e1.dateOfBirth() < e2.dateOfBirth();
    }

    #endif // EMPLOYEE_H

   In the example, we start by comparing the employees' names. If they're
   equal, we compare their dates of birth to break the tie.

Member Function Documentation

  QMap::QMap ()

   Constructs an empty map.

   See also clear().

  QMap::QMap ( const QMap<Key, T> & other )

   Constructs a copy of other.

   This operation occurs in constant time, because QMap is implicitly
   shared. This makes returning a QMap from a function very fast. If a
   shared instance is modified, it will be copied (copy-on-write), and
   this takes linear time.

   See also operator=().

  QMap::QMap ( const std::map<Key, T> & other )

   Constructs a copy of other.

   This function is only available if Qt is configured with STL
   compabitility enabled.

   See also toStdMap().

  QMap::~QMap ()

   Destroys the map. References to the values in the map, and all
   iterators over this map, become invalid.

  iterator QMap::begin ()

   Returns an STL-style iterator pointing to the first item in the map.

   See also constBegin() and end().

  const_iterator QMap::begin () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  void QMap::clear ()

   Removes all items from the map.

   See also remove().

  const_iterator QMap::constBegin () const

   Returns a const STL-style iterator pointing to the first item in the
   map.

   See also begin() and constEnd().

  const_iterator QMap::constEnd () const

   Returns a const STL-style iterator pointing to the imaginary item
   after the last item in the map.

   See also constBegin() and end().

  bool QMap::contains ( const Key & key ) const

   Returns true if the map contains an item with key key; otherwise
   returns false.

   See also count().

  int QMap::count ( const Key & key ) const

   Returns the number of items associated with key key.

   See also contains() and insertMulti().

  int QMap::count () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Same as size().

  bool QMap::empty () const

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   isEmpty().

  iterator QMap::end ()

   Returns an STL-style iterator pointing to the imaginary item after the
   last item in the map.

   See also begin() and constEnd().

  const_iterator QMap::end () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  iterator QMap::erase ( iterator pos )

   Removes the (key, value) pair pointed to by the iterator pos from the
   map, and returns an iterator to the next item in the map.

   See also remove().

  iterator QMap::find ( const Key & key )

   Returns an iterator pointing to the item with key key in the map.

   If the map contains no item with key key, the function returns end().

   If the map contains multiple items with key key, this function returns
   an iterator that points to the most recently inserted value. The other
   values are accessible by incrementing the iterator. For example,
   here's some code that iterates over all the items with the same key:
    QMap<QString, int> map;
    ...
    QMap<QString, int>::const_iterator i = map.find("HDR");
    while (i != map.end() && i.key() == "HDR") {
        cout << i.value() << endl;
        ++i;
    }

   See also value(), values(), lowerBound(), and upperBound().

  const_iterator QMap::find ( const Key & key ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  iterator QMap::insert ( const Key & key, const T & value )

   Inserts a new item with the key key and a value of value.

   If there is already an item with the key key, that item's value is
   replaced with value.

   If there are multiple items with the key key, the most recently
   inserted item's value is replaced with value.

   See also insertMulti().

  iterator QMap::insertMulti ( const Key & key, const T & value )

   Inserts a new item with the key key and a value of value.

   If there is already an item with the same key in the map, this
   function will simply create a new one. (This behavior is different
   from insert(), which overwrites the value of an existing item.)

   See also insert() and values().

  bool QMap::isEmpty () const

   Returns true if the map contains no items; otherwise returns false.

   See also size().

  const Key QMap::key ( const T & value ) const

   Returns the first key with value value.

   If the map contains no item with value value, the function returns a
   default-constructed key.

   This function can be slow (linear time), because QMap's internal data
   structure is optimized for fast lookup by key, not by value.

   See also value() and values().

  QList<Key> QMap::keys () const

   Returns a list containing all the keys in the map, in an arbitrary
   order. Keys that occur multiple times in the map (because items were
   inserted with insertMulti(), or unite() was used), also occur multiple
   times in the list.

   The order is guaranteed to be the same as that used by values().

   See also values() and key().

  QList<Key> QMap::keys ( const T & value ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a list containing all the keys associated with value value, in
   ascending order.

   This function can be slow (linear time), because QMap's internal data
   structure is optimized for fast lookup by key, not by value.

  iterator QMap::lowerBound ( const Key & key )

   Returns an iterator pointing to the first item with key key in the
   map. If the map contains no item with key key, the function returns an
   iterator to the nearest item with a greater key.

   Example:
    QMap<int, QString> map;
    map.insert(1, "one");
    map.insert(5, "five");
    map.insert(10, "ten");

    map.lowerBound(0);      // returns iterator to (1, "one")
    map.lowerBound(1);      // returns iterator to (1, "one")
    map.lowerBound(2);      // returns iterator to (5, "five")
    map.lowerBound(10);     // returns iterator to (10, "ten")
    map.lowerBound(999);    // returns end()

   If the map contains multiple items with key key, this function returns
   an iterator that points to the most recently inserted value. The other
   values are accessible by incrementing the iterator. For example,
   here's some code that iterates over all the items with the same key:
    QMap<QString, int> map;
    ...
    QMap<QString, int>::const_iterator i = map.lowerBound("HDR");
    QMap<QString, int>::const_iterator upperBound = map.upperBound("HDR");
    while (i != upperBound) {
        cout << i.value() << endl;
        ++i;
    }

   See also qLowerBound(), upperBound(), and find().

  const_iterator QMap::lowerBound ( const Key & key ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  int QMap::remove ( const Key & key )

   Removes all the items that have the key key from the map. Returns the
   number of items removed which is usually 1 but will be 0 if the key
   isn't in the map, or > 1 if insertMulti() has been used with the key.

   See also clear() and take().

  int QMap::size () const

   Returns the number of (key, value) pairs in the map.

   See also isEmpty() and count().

  T QMap::take ( const Key & key )

   Removes the item with the key key from the map and returns the value
   associated with it.

   If the item does not exist in the map, the function simply returns a
   default-constructed value. If there are multiple items for key in the
   map, only the most recently inserted one is removed and returned.

   If you don't use the return value, remove() is more efficient.

   See also remove().

  std::map<Key, T> QMap::toStdMap () const

   Returns an STL map equivalent to this QMap.

   This function is only available if Qt is configured with STL
   compabitility enabled.

  QMap<Key, T> & QMap::unite ( const QMap<Key, T> & other )

   Inserts all the items in the other map into this map. If a key is
   common to both maps, the resulting map will contain the key multiple
   times.

   See also insertMulti().

  iterator QMap::upperBound ( const Key & key )

   Returns an iterator pointing to the item that immediately follows the
   last item with key key in the map. If the map contains no item with
   key key, the function returns an iterator to the nearest item with a
   greater key.

   Example:
    QMap<int, QString> map;
    map.insert(1, "one");
    map.insert(5, "five");
    map.insert(10, "ten");

    map.upperBound(0);      // returns iterator to (1, "one")
    map.upperBound(1);      // returns iterator to (5, "five")
    map.upperBound(2);      // returns iterator to (5, "five")
    map.upperBound(10);     // returns end()
    map.upperBound(999);    // returns end()

   See also qUpperBound(), lowerBound(), and find().

  const_iterator QMap::upperBound ( const Key & key ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  const T QMap::value ( const Key & key ) const

   Returns the value associated with the key key.

   If the map contains no item with key key, the function returns a
   default-constructed value. If there are multiple items for key in the
   map, the value of the most recently inserted one is returned.

   See also key(), values(), contains(), and operator[]().

  const T QMap::value ( const Key & key, const T & defaultValue ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   If the map contains no item with key key, the function returns
   defaultValue.

  QList<T> QMap::values () const

   Returns a list containing all the values in the map, in ascending
   order of their keys. If a key is associated multiple values, all of
   its values will be in the list, and not just the most recently
   inserted one.

   See also keys().

  QList<T> QMap::values ( const Key & key ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a list containing all the values associated with key key, from
   the most recently inserted to the least recently inserted one.

   See also count() and insertMulti().

  bool QMap::operator!= ( const QMap<Key, T> & other ) const

   Returns true if other is not equal to this map; otherwise returns
   false.

   Two maps are considered equal if they contain the same (key, value)
   pairs.

   This function requires the value type to implement operator==().

   See also operator==().

  QMap<Key, T> & QMap::operator= ( const QMap<Key, T> & other )

   Assigns other to this map and returns a reference to this map.

  bool QMap::operator== ( const QMap<Key, T> & other ) const

   Returns true if other is equal to this map; otherwise returns false.

   Two maps are considered equal if they contain the same (key, value)
   pairs.

   This function requires the value type to implement operator==().

   See also operator!=().

  T & QMap::operator[] ( const Key & key )

   Returns the value associated with the key key as a modifiable
   reference.

   If the map contains no item with key key, the function inserts a
   default-constructed value into the map with key key, and returns a
   reference to it. If the map contains multiple items with key key, this
   function returns a reference to the most recently inserted value.

   See also insert() and value().

  const T QMap::operator[] ( const Key & key ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Same as value().
