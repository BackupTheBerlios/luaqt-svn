Detailed Description

   The QStack class is a template class that provides a stack.

   QStack<T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It implements a
   stack data structure for items of a same type.

   A stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure. Items are added to
   the top of the stack using push() and retrieved from the top using
   pop(). The top() function provides access to the topmost item without
   removing it.

   Example:
    QStack<int> stack;
    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);
    while (!stack.isEmpty())
        cout << stack.pop() << endl;

   The example will output 3, 2, 1 in that order.

   QStack inherits from QVector. All of QVector's functionality also
   applies to QStack. For example, you can use isEmpty() to test whether
   the stack is empty, and you can traverse a QStack using QVector's
   iterator classes (for example, QVectorIterator). But in addition,
   QStack provides three convenience functions that make it easy to
   implement LIFO semantics: push(), pop(), and top().

   QStack's value type must be an assignable data type. This covers most
   data types that are commonly used, but the compiler won't let you, for
   example, store a QWidget as a value; instead, store a QWidget *.

   See also QVector and QQueue.

Member Function Documentation

  QStack::QStack ()

   Constructs an empty stack.

  QStack::~QStack ()

   Destroys the stack. References to the values in the stack, and all
   iterators over this stack, become invalid.

  T QStack::pop ()

   Removes the top item from the stack and returns it. This function
   assumes that the stack isn't empty.

   See also top(), push(), and isEmpty().

  void QStack::push ( const T & t )

   Adds element t to the top of the stack.

   This is the same as QVector::append().

   See also pop() and top().

  T & QStack::top ()

   Returns a reference to the stack's top item. This function assumes
   that the stack isn't empty.

   This is the same as QVector::last().

   See also pop(), push(), and isEmpty().

  const T & QStack::top () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   See also pop() and push().
