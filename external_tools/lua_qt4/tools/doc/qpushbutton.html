Detailed Description

   The QPushButton widget provides a command button.

   The push button, or command button, is perhaps the most commonly used
   widget in any graphical user interface. Push (click) a button to
   command the computer to perform some action, or to answer a question.
   Typical buttons are OK, Apply, Cancel, Close, Yes, No and Help.

   A command button is rectangular and typically displays a text label
   describing its action. An underlined character in the label (signified
   by preceding it with an ampersand in the text) indicates a shortcut
   key, e.g.
    QPushButton *pb = new QPushButton("&Download", this);

   In this example the shortcut is Alt+D, and the label text will be
   displayed as Download.

   Push buttons display a textual label, and optionally a small icon.
   These can be set using the constructors and changed later using
   setText() and setIcon(). If the button is disabled the appearance of
   the text and icon will be manipulated with respect to the GUI style to
   make the button look "disabled".

   A push button emits the signal clicked() when it is activated by the
   mouse, the Spacebar or by a keyboard shortcut. Connect to this signal
   to perform the button's action. Push buttons also provide less
   commonly used signals, for example, pressed() and released().

   Command buttons in dialogs are by default auto-default buttons, i.e.
   they become the default push button automatically when they receive
   the keyboard input focus. A default button is a push button that is
   activated when the user presses the Enter or Return key in a dialog.
   You can change this with setAutoDefault(). Note that auto-default
   buttons reserve a little extra space which is necessary to draw a
   default-button indicator. If you do not want this space around your
   buttons, call setAutoDefault(false).

   Being so central, the button widget has grown to accommodate a great
   many variations in the past decade. The Microsoft style guide now
   shows about ten different states of Windows push buttons and the text
   implies that there are dozens more when all the combinations of
   features are taken into consideration.

   The most important modes or states are:
     * Available or not (grayed out, disabled).
     * Standard push button, toggling push button or menu button.
     * On or off (only for toggling push buttons).
     * Default or normal. The default button in a dialog can generally be
       "clicked" using the Enter or Return key.
     * Auto-repeat or not.
     * Pressed down or not.

   As a general rule, use a push button when the application or dialog
   window performs an action when the user clicks on it (such as Apply,
   Cancel, Close and Help) and when the widget is supposed to have a
   wide, rectangular shape with a text label. Small, typically square
   buttons that change the state of the window rather than performing an
   action (such as the buttons in the top-right corner of the
   QFileDialog) are not command buttons, but tool buttons. Qt provides a
   special class (QToolButton) for these buttons.

   If you need toggle behavior (see setCheckable()) or a button that
   auto-repeats the activation signal when being pushed down like the
   arrows in a scroll bar (see setAutoRepeat()), a command button is
   probably not what you want. When in doubt, use a tool button.

   A variation of a command button is a menu button. These provide not
   just one command, but several, since when they are clicked they pop up
   a menu of options. Use the method setMenu() to associate a popup menu
   with a push button.

   Other classes of buttons are option buttons (see QRadioButton) and
   check boxes (see QCheckBox).

   In Qt, the QAbstractButton base class provides most of the modes and
   other API, and QPushButton provides GUI logic. See QAbstractButton for
   more information about the API.

Property Documentation

  autoDefault : bool

   This property holds whether the push button is the auto default
   button.

   If this property is set to true then the push button is the auto
   default button in a dialog.

   In some GUI styles a default button is drawn with an extra frame
   around it, up to 3 pixels or more. Qt automatically keeps this space
   free around auto-default buttons, i.e. auto-default buttons may have a
   slightly larger size hint.

   This property's default is true for buttons that have a QDialog
   parent; otherwise it defaults to false.

   See the default property for details of how default and auto-default
   interact.

   Access functions:
     * bool autoDefault () const
     * void setAutoDefault ( bool )

  default : bool

   This property holds whether the push button is the default button.

   If this property is set to true then the push button will be pressed
   if the user presses the Enter (or Return) key in a dialog.

   Regardless of focus, if the user presses Enter: If there is a default
   button the default button is pressed; otherwise, if there are one or
   more autoDefault buttons the first autoDefault button that is next in
   the tab order is pressed. If there are no default or autoDefault
   buttons only pressing Space on a button with focus, mouse clicking, or
   using a shortcut will press a button.

   In a dialog, only one push button at a time can be the default button.
   This button is then displayed with an additional frame (depending on
   the GUI style).

   The default button behavior is provided only in dialogs. Buttons can
   always be clicked from the keyboard by pressing Enter (or Return) or
   the Spacebar when the button has focus.

   This property's default is false.

   Access functions:
     * bool isDefault () const
     * void setDefault ( bool )

  flat : bool

   This property holds whether the border is disabled.

   This property's default is false.

   Access functions:
     * bool isFlat () const
     * void setFlat ( bool )

Member Function Documentation

  QPushButton::QPushButton ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a push button with no text and a parent.

  QPushButton::QPushButton ( const QString & text, QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a push button with the parent parent and the text text.

  QPushButton::QPushButton ( const QIcon & icon, const QString & text, QWidget
  * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a push button with an icon and a text, and a parent.

   Note that you can also pass a QPixmap object as an icon (thanks to the
   implicit type conversion provided by C++).

  QPushButton::~QPushButton ()

   Destroys the push button.

  QMenu * QPushButton::menu () const

   Returns the button's associated popup menu or 0 if no popup menu has
   been set.

   See also setMenu().

  void QPushButton::setMenu ( QMenu * menu )

   Associates the popup menu menu with this push button. This turns the
   button into a menu button, which in some styles will produce a small
   triangle to the right of the button's text.

   Ownership of the menu is not transferred to the push button.

   See also menu().

  void QPushButton::showMenu ()   [slot]

   Shows (pops up) the associated popup menu. If there is no such menu,
   this function does nothing. This function does not return until the
   popup menu has been closed by the user.
