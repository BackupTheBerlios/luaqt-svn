Detailed Description

   The QMainWindow class provides a main application window.

   QMainWindow provides a main application window, with a menu bar, tool
   bars, dock widgets and a status bar around a large central widget,
   such as a text edit, drawing canvas or Q3Workspace (for MDI
   applications).

   Topics:
     * Saving and restoring state
     * Behavior of Dock Widgets

     * Dock Widget Separators
     * Dragging Dock Widgets
     * Dragging over Neighbors
     * Dragging over other QDockWidgets
     * Dragging to a Different Qt::DockWidgetArea

  Saving and restoring state

   The saveState() and restoreState() functions provide a means to save
   and restore the layout of the QToolBars and QDockWidgets in the
   QMainWindow. These functions work by storing the objectName of each
   QToolBar and QDockWidget together with information about placement,
   size, etc.

  Behavior of Dock Widgets

    Dock Widget Separators

   QMainWindow uses separators to separate QDockWidgets from each other
   and the central widget. These separators let the user control the size
   of QDockWidgets by dragging the boundary between them.

   A QDockWidget can be as large or as small as the user wishes, between
   the minimumSizeHint() (or minimumSize()) and maximumSize() of the
   QDockWidget. When a QDockWidget reaches its minimum size, space will
   be taken from other QDockWidgets in the direction of the user's drag,
   if possible. Once all QDockWidgets have reached their minimum sizes,
   further dragging does nothing. When a QDockWidget reaches its maximium
   size, space will be given to other QDockWidgets in the opposite
   direction of the user's drag, if possible. Once all QDockWidgets have
   reached their minimum size, futher dragging does nothing.

    Dragging Dock Widgets

   QDockWidget displays a title bar to let the user drag the dock widget
   to a new location. A QDockWidget can be moved to any location provided
   enough space is available. (QMainWindow won't resize itself to a
   larger size in an attempt to provide more space.)

   A QRubberBand is shown while dragging the QDockWidget. This
   QRubberBand provides an indication to the user about where the
   QDockWidget will be placed when the mouse button is released.

    Dragging over Neighbors

   All un-nested QDockWidgets in the same dock area are considered
   neighbors. When dragging a QDockWidget over its neighbor:
     * QMainWindow will split the neighbor perpendicularly to the
       direction of the QDockWidgets.
     * QMainWindow will swap the position of the QDockWidget being
       dragged and its neighbor once the user has dragged the mouse past
       the center point of the neighboring QDockWidget.

   The following diagram depicts this behavior:

                                  Diagram

    Dragging over other QDockWidgets

   When dragging nested QDockWidgets, or when dragging to a different
   dock area, QMainWindow will split the QDockWindow under the mouse. Be
   aware that the QDockWidget under the mouse will only be split by the
   QDockWidget being dragged if both can fit in the space currently
   occupied by the QDockWidget under the mouse.

   A QDockWidget can be split horizontally or vertically, with the
   QDockWidget being dragged being placed in one of four possible
   locations, as shown in the diagram below:

                                  Diagram

    Dragging to a Different Qt::DockWidgetArea

   The QDockWidget::floatable property influences feedback when the user
   drags a QDockWidget over the central widget:
     * If floating is true, QMainWindow chooses a dock area based on the
       position of the mouse pointer. If the mouse is within 50 pixels of
       the central widget's edge, the adjacent dock area is chosen. When
       dragging into the corners of these 50 pixel regions, the current
       corner() configuration is used to make the decision. Otherwise,
       the QRubberBand is shown under the mouse pointer, as above.
     * If floating is false, QMainWindow chooses a dock area based on the
       distance between the mouse pointer and the center of the central
       widget. If the mouse comes within 50 pixels of the central
       widget's edge, the adjacent dock area is always chosen. When
       dragging into the corners of these 50 pixel regions, the current
       corner() configuration is used to make the decision.

   In either case, dragging the mouse over another QDockWidget causes
   QMainWindow to choose the other QDockWidget's dock area.

   When dragging outside the QMainWindow, the QDockWidget::floating
   property again controls feedback during dragging. When the property is
   false, dragging outside of the QMainWindow will show the rubberband
   over the QDockWidget's current location. This indicates that the
   QDockWidget cannot be moved outside of the QMainWindow. When the
   QDockWidget::floatable property is true, dragging outside of the
   QMainWindow will show the QRubberBand under the mouse pointer. This
   indicates that the QDockWidget will be floating when the mouse button
   is released.

   See also setCorner().

  QMenu * QMainWindow::createPopupMenu ()   [virtual]

   This function is called to create a popup menu when the user
   right-clicks on the menu bar, a toolbar or a dock widget. If you want
   to create a custom popup menu, reimplement this function and return
   the created popup menu. Ownership of the popup menu is transferred to
   the caller.

  Qt::DockWidgetArea QMainWindow::dockWidgetArea ( QDockWidget * dockwidget )
  const

   Returns the Qt::DockWidgetArea for dockwidget.

   See also addDockWidget(), splitDockWidget(), and Qt::DockWidgetArea.

  void QMainWindow::iconSizeChanged ( const QSize & iconSize )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the size of the icons used in the window
   is changed. The new icon size is passed in iconSize.

   You can connect this signal to other components to help maintain a
   consistent appearance for your application.

   See also setIconSize().

  void QMainWindow::insertToolBar ( QToolBar * before, QToolBar * toolbar )

   Inserts the toolbar into the area occupied by the before toolbar so
   that it appears before it. For example, in normal left-to-right layout
   operation, this means that toolbar will appear to the left of the
   toolbar specified by before in a horizontal toolbar area.

   See also insertToolBarBreak(), addToolBar(), and addToolBarBreak().

  void QMainWindow::insertToolBarBreak ( QToolBar * before )

   Inserts a toolbar break before the toolbar specified by before.

  QMenuBar * QMainWindow::menuBar () const

   Returns the menu bar for the main window. This function creates and
   returns an empty menu bar if the menu bar does not exist.

   See also setMenuBar().

  void QMainWindow::removeDockWidget ( QDockWidget * dockwidget )

   Removes the dockwidget from the main window.

  void QMainWindow::removeToolBar ( QToolBar * toolbar )

   Removes the toolbar from the main window.

  bool QMainWindow::restoreState ( const QByteArray & state, int version = 0 )

   Restores the state of this mainwindow's toolbars and dockwidgets. The
   version number is compared with that stored in state. If they do not
   match, the mainwindow's state is left unchanged, and this function
   returns false; otherwise, the state is restored, and this function
   returns true.

   See also saveState().

  QByteArray QMainWindow::saveState ( int version = 0 ) const

   Saves the current state of this mainwindow's toolbars and dockwidgets.
   The version number is stored as part of the data.

   The objectName property is used to identify each QToolBar and
   QDockWidget. You should make sure that this property is unique for
   each QToolBar and QDockWidget you add to the QMainWindow

   To restore the saved state, pass the return value and version number
   to restoreState().

   See also restoreState().

  void QMainWindow::setCentralWidget ( QWidget * widget )

   Sets the given widget to be the main window's central widget.

   Warning: This function should be called at most once for each main
   window instance

   Note: QMainWindow takes ownership of the widget pointer and deletes it
   at the appropriate time.

   See also centralWidget().

  void QMainWindow::setCorner ( Qt::Corner corner, Qt::DockWidgetArea area )

   Sets the given dock widget area to occupy the specified corner.

   See also corner().

  void QMainWindow::setMenuBar ( QMenuBar * menuBar )

   Sets the menu bar for the main window to menuBar.

   Note: QMainWindow takes ownership of the menuBar pointer and deletes
   it at the appropriate time.

   See also menuBar().

  void QMainWindow::setStatusBar ( QStatusBar * statusbar )

   Sets the status bar for the main window to statusbar.

   Note: QMainWindow takes ownership of the statusbar pointer and deletes
   it at the appropriate time.

   See also statusBar().

  void QMainWindow::splitDockWidget ( QDockWidget * first, QDockWidget *
  second, Qt::Orientation orientation )

   Splits the space covered by the first dock widget into two parts,
   moves the first dock widget into the first part, and moves the second
   dock widget into the second part.

   The orientation specifies how the space is divided: A Qt::Horizontal
   split places the second dock widget to the right of the first; a
   Qt::Vertical split places the second dock widget below the first.

   Note: The Qt::LayoutDirection influences the order of the dock widgets
   in the two parts of the divided area. When right-to-left layout
   direction is enabled, the placing of the dock widgets will be
   reversed.

  QStatusBar * QMainWindow::statusBar () const

   Returns the status bar for the main window. This function creates and
   returns an empty status bar if the status bar does not exist.

   See also setStatusBar().

  Qt::ToolBarArea QMainWindow::toolBarArea ( QToolBar * toolbar ) const

   Returns the tool bar area for toolbar.

   See also addToolBar(), addToolBarBreak(), and Qt::ToolBarArea.

  void QMainWindow::toolButtonStyleChanged ( Qt::ToolButtonStyle
  toolButtonStyle )   [signal]

   This signal is emiited when the style used for tool buttons in the
   window is changed. The new style is passed in toolButtonStyle.

   You can connect this signal to other components to help maintain a
   consistent appearance for your application.

   See also setToolButtonStyle().
