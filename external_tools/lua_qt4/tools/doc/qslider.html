Detailed Description

   The QSlider widget provides a vertical or horizontal slider.

   The slider is the classic widget for controlling a bounded value. It
   lets the user move a slider handle along a horizontal or vertical
   groove and translates the handle's position into an integer value
   within the legal range.

   QSlider has very few of its own functions; most of the functionality
   is in QAbstractSlider. The most useful functions are setValue() to set
   the slider directly to some value; triggerAction() to simulate the
   effects of clicking (useful for shortcut keys); setSingleStep(),
   setPageStep() to set the steps; and setMinimum() and setMaximum() to
   define the range of the scroll bar.

   QSlider provides methods for controlling tickmarks. You can use
   setTickPosition() to indicate where you want the tickmarks to be,
   setTickInterval() to indicate how many of them you want.

   QSlider inherits a comprehensive set of signals:

                            Signal Emitted when
       valueChanged() the slider's value has changed. The tracking()
     determines whether this signal is emitted during user interaction.
            sliderPressed() the user starts to drag the slider.
                  sliderMoved() the user drags the slider.
               sliderReleased() the user releases the slider.

   QSlider only provides integer ranges. Note that although QSlider
   handles very large numbers, it becomes difficult for users to use a
   slider accurately for very large ranges.

   A slider accepts focus on Tab and provides both a mouse wheel and a
   keyboard interface. The keyboard interface is the following:
     * Left/Right move a horizontal slider by one single step.
     * Up/Down move a vertical slider by one single step.
     * PageUp moves up one page.
     * PageDown moves down one page.
     * Home moves to the start (mininum).
     * End moves to the end (maximum).

Member Type Documentation

  enum QSlider::TickPosition

   This enum specifies where the tick marks are to be drawn relative to
   the slider's groove and the handle the user moves.

   Constant Value Description
   QSlider::NoTicks 0 do not draw any tick marks.
   QSlider::TicksBothSides 3 draw tick marks on both sides of the groove.
   QSlider::TicksAbove 1 draw tick marks above the (horizontal) slider
   QSlider::TicksBelow 2 draw tick marks below the (horizontal) slider
   QSlider::TicksLeft TicksAbove draw tick marks to the left of the
   (vertical) slider
   QSlider::TicksRight TicksBelow draw tick marks to the right of the
   (vertical) slider

Property Documentation

  tickInterval : int

   This property holds the interval between tickmarks.

   This is a value interval, not a pixel interval. If it is 0, the slider
   will choose between lineStep() and pageStep(). The initial value of
   tickInterval is 0.

   Access functions:
     * int tickInterval () const
     * void setTickInterval ( int ti )

   See also tickPosition, lineStep(), and pageStep().

  tickPosition : TickPosition

   This property holds the tickmark position for this slider.

   The valid values are in QSlider::TickPosition. The default is NoTicks.

   Access functions:
     * TickPosition tickPosition () const
     * void setTickPosition ( TickPosition position )

   See also tickInterval.

Member Function Documentation

  QSlider::QSlider ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a vertical slider.

   The parent argument is sent to the QAbstractSlider constructor.

  QSlider::QSlider ( Qt::Orientation orientation, QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a slider.

   The orientation must be Qt::Vertical or Qt::Horizontal.

   The parent argument is sent on to the QAbstractSlider constructor.

  QSlider::~QSlider ()

   Destructor.
