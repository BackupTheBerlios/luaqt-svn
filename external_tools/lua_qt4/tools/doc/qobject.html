Detailed Description

   The QObject class is the base class of all Qt objects.

   QObject is the heart of the Qt object model. The central feature in
   this model is a very powerful mechanism for seamless object
   communication called signals and slots. You can connect a signal to a
   slot with connect() and destroy the connection with disconnect(). To
   avoid never ending notification loops you can temporarily block
   signals with blockSignals(). The protected functions connectNotify()
   and disconnectNotify() make it possible to track connections.

   QObjects organize themselves in object trees. When you create a
   QObject with another object as parent, the object will automatically
   add itself to the parent's children() list. The parent takes ownership
   of the object i.e. it will automatically delete its children in its
   destructor. You can look for an object by name and optionally type
   using findChild() or findChildren().

   Every object has an objectName() and its class name can be found via
   the corresponding metaObject() (see QMetaObject::className()). You can
   determine whether the object's class inherits another class in the
   QObject inheritance hierarchy by using the inherits() function.

   When an object is deleted, it emits a destroyed() signal. You can
   catch this signal to avoid dangling references to QObjects. The
   QPointer class provides an elegant way to use this feature.

   QObjects can receive events through event() and filter the events of
   other objects. See installEventFilter() and eventFilter() for details.
   A convenience handler, childEvent(), can be reimplemented to catch
   child events. Events are delivered in the thread in which the object
   was created; see Thread Support in Qt and thread() for details.

   Last but not least, QObject provides the basic timer support in Qt;
   see QTimer for high-level support for timers.

   Notice that the Q_OBJECT macro is mandatory for any object that
   implements signals, slots or properties. You also need to run the Meta
   Object Compiler on the source file. We strongly recommend the use of
   this macro in all subclasses of QObject regardless of whether or not
   they actually use signals, slots and properties, since failure to do
   so may lead certain functions to exhibit strange behavior.

   All Qt widgets inherit QObject. The convenience function
   isWidgetType() returns whether an object is actually a widget. It is
   much faster than qobject_cast<QWidget>(obj) or
   obj->inherits("QWidget").

   Some QObject functions, e.g. children(), return a QObjectList.
   QObjectList is a typedef for QList<QObject *>.

   See also QMetaObject, QPointer, QObjectCleanupHandler, and Object
   Trees and Object Ownership.

Property Documentation

  objectName : QString

   This property holds the name of this object.

   You can find an object by name (and type) using findChild(). You can
   find a set of objects with findChildren().
    qDebug("MyClass::setPrecision(): (%s) invalid precision %f",
           qPrintable(objectName()), newPrecision);

   Access functions:
     * QString objectName () const
     * void setObjectName ( const QString & name )

   See also metaObject() and QMetaObject::className().

Member Function Documentation

  QObject::QObject ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs an object with parent object parent.

   The parent of an object may be viewed as the object's owner. For
   instance, a dialog box is the parent of the OK and Cancel buttons it
   contains.

   The destructor of a parent object destroys all child objects.

   Setting parent to 0 constructs an object with no parent. If the object
   is a widget, it will become a top-level window.

   See also parent(), findChild(), and findChildren().

  QObject::~QObject ()   [virtual]

   Destroys the object, deleting all its child objects.

   All signals to and from the object are automatically disconnected.

   Warning: All child objects are deleted. If any of these objects are on
   the stack or global, sooner or later your program will crash. We do
   not recommend holding pointers to child objects from outside the
   parent. If you still do, the destroyed() signal gives you an
   opportunity to detect when an object is destroyed.

   Warning: Deleting a QObject while pending events are waiting to be
   delivered can cause a crash. You must not delete the QObject directly
   from a thread that is not the GUI thread. Use the deleteLater() method
   instead, which will cause the event loop to delete the object after
   all pending events have been delivered to the object.

   See also deleteLater().

  bool QObject::blockSignals ( bool block )

   Blocks signals if block is true, or unblocks signals if block is
   false.

   Emitted signals disappear into hyperspace if signals are blocked. Note
   that the destroyed() signals will be emitted even if the signals for
   this object have been blocked.

   See also signalsBlocked().

  void QObject::childEvent ( QChildEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive child
   events. The event is passed in the event parameter.

   QEvent::ChildAdded and QEvent::ChildRemoved events are sent to objects
   when children are added or removed. In both cases you can only rely on
   the child being a QObject, or if isWidgetType() returns true, a
   QWidget. (This is because, in the ChildAdded case, the child is not
   yet fully constructed, and in the ChildRemoved case it might have been
   destructed already).

   QEvent::ChildPolished events are sent to widgets when children are
   polished, or when polished children are added. If you receive a child
   polished event, the child's construction is usually completed.

   For every child widget, you receive one ChildAdded event, zero or more
   ChildPolished events, and one ChildRemoved event.

   The ChildPolished event is omitted if a child is removed immediately
   after it is added. If a child is polished several times during
   construction and destruction, you may receive several child polished
   events for the same child, each time with a different virtual table.

   See also event().

  const QObjectList & QObject::children () const

   Returns a list of child objects. The QObjectList class is defined in
   the <QObject> header file as the following:
    typedef QList<QObject*> QObjectList;

   The first child added is the first object in the list and the last
   child added is the last object in the list, i.e. new children are
   appended at the end.

   Note that the list order changes when QWidget children are raised or
   lowered. A widget that is raised becomes the last object in the list,
   and a widget that is lowered becomes the first object in the list.

   See also findChild(), findChildren(), parent(), and setParent().

  bool QObject::connect ( const QObject * sender, const char * signal, const
  QObject * receiver, const char * method, Qt::ConnectionType type =
  Qt::AutoCompatConnection )   [static]

   Creates a connection of the given type from the signal in the sender
   object to the method in the receiver object. Returns true if the
   connection succeeds; otherwise returns false.

   You must use the SIGNAL() and SLOT() macros when specifying the signal
   and the method, for example:
    QLabel *label = new QLabel;
    QScrollBar *scrollBar = new QScrollBar;
    QObject::connect(scroll, SIGNAL(valueChanged(int)),
                     label,  SLOT(setNum(int)));

   This example ensures that the label always displays the current scroll
   bar value. Note that the signal and slots parameters must not contain
   any variable names, only the type. E.g. the following would not work
   and return false:
    // WRONG
    QObject::connect(scroll, SIGNAL(valueChanged(int value)),
                     label, SLOT(setNum(int value)));

   A signal can also be connected to another signal:
    class MyWidget : public QWidget
    {
        Q_OBJECT

    public:
        MyWidget();

    signals:
        void buttonClicked();

    private:
        QPushButton *myButton;
    };

    MyWidget::MyWidget()
    {
        myButton = new QPushButton(this);
        connect(myButton, SIGNAL(clicked()),
                this, SIGNAL(buttonClicked()));
    }

   In this example, the MyWidget constructor relays a signal from a
   private member variable, and makes it available under a name that
   relates to MyWidget.

   A signal can be connected to many slots and signals. Many signals can
   be connected to one slot.

   If a signal is connected to several slots, the slots are activated in
   an arbitrary order when the signal is emitted.

   The function returns true if it successfully connects the signal to
   the slot. It will return false if it cannot create the connection, for
   example, if QObject is unable to verify the existence of either signal
   or method, or if their signatures aren't compatible.

   A signal is emitted for every connection you make, so if you duplicate
   a connection, two signals will be emitted. You can always break a
   connection using disconnect().

   Note: This function is thread-safe.

   See also disconnect().

  bool QObject::connect ( const QObject * sender, const char * signal, const
  char * method, Qt::ConnectionType type = Qt::AutoCompatConnection ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Connects signal from the sender object to this object's method.

   Equivalent to connect(sender, signal, this, method, type).

   Note: This function is thread-safe.

   See also disconnect().

  void QObject::connectNotify ( const char * signal )   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is called when something has been connected to
   signal in this object.

   If you want to compare signal with a specific signal, use
   QLatin1String and the SIGNAL() macro as follows:
    if (QLatin1String(signal) == SIGNAL(valueChanged(int))) {
        // signal is valueChanged(int)
    }

   If the signal contains multiple parameters or parameters that contain
   spaces, call QMetaObject::normalizedSignature() on the result of the
   SIGNAL() macro.

   Warning: This function violates the object-oriented principle of
   modularity. However, it might be useful when you need to perform
   expensive initialization only if something is connected to a signal.

   See also connect() and disconnectNotify().

  void QObject::customEvent ( QEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
   custom events. Custom events are user-defined events with a type value
   at least as large as the QEvent::User item of the QEvent::Type enum,
   and is typically a QEvent subclass. The event is passed in the event
   parameter.

   See also event() and QEvent.

  void QObject::deleteLater ()   [slot]

   Performs a deferred deletion of this object.

   Instead of an immediate deletion this function schedules a deferred
   delete event for processing when Qt returns to the main event loop.

   See also destroyed() and QPointer.

  void QObject::destroyed ( QObject * obj = 0 )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted immediately before the object obj is destroyed,
   and can not be blocked.

   All the objects's children are destroyed immediately after this signal
   is emitted.

   See also deleteLater() and QPointer.

  bool QObject::disconnect ( const QObject * sender, const char * signal, const
  QObject * receiver, const char * method )   [static]

   Disconnects signal in object sender from method in object receiver.

   A signal-slot connection is removed when either of the objects
   involved are destroyed.

   disconnect() is typically used in three ways, as the following
   examples demonstrate.
    1. Disconnect everything connected to an object's signals:
    disconnect(myObject, 0, 0, 0);
       equivalent to the non-static overloaded function
    myObject->disconnect();
    2. Disconnect everything connected to a specific signal:
    disconnect(myObject, SIGNAL(mySignal()), 0, 0);
       equivalent to the non-static overloaded function
    myObject->disconnect(SIGNAL(mySignal()));
    3. Disconnect a specific receiver:
    disconnect(myObject, 0, myReceiver, 0);
       equivalent to the non-static overloaded function
    myObject->disconnect(myReceiver);

   0 may be used as a wildcard, meaning "any signal", "any receiving
   object", or "any slot in the receiving object", respectively.

   The sender may never be 0. (You cannot disconnect signals from more
   than one object in a single call.)

   If signal is 0, it disconnects receiver and method from any signal. If
   not, only the specified signal is disconnected.

   If receiver is 0, it disconnects anything connected to signal. If not,
   slots in objects other than receiver are not disconnected.

   If method is 0, it disconnects anything that is connected to receiver.
   If not, only slots named method will be disconnected, and all other
   slots are left alone. The method must be 0 if receiver is left out, so
   you cannot disconnect a specifically-named slot on all objects.

   Note: This function is thread-safe.

   See also connect().

  bool QObject::disconnect ( const char * signal = 0, const QObject * receiver
  = 0, const char * method = 0 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Disconnects signal from method of receiver.

   A signal-slot connection is removed when either of the objects
   involved are destroyed.

   Note: This function is thread-safe.

  bool QObject::disconnect ( const QObject * receiver, const char * method = 0
  )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Disconnects all signals in this object from receiver's method.

   A signal-slot connection is removed when either of the objects
   involved are destroyed.

  void QObject::disconnectNotify ( const char * signal )   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is called when something has been disconnected
   from signal in this object.

   See connectNotify() for an example of how to compare signal with a
   specific signal.

   Warning: This function violates the object-oriented principle of
   modularity. However, it might be useful for optimizing access to
   expensive resources.

   See also disconnect() and connectNotify().

  void QObject::dumpObjectInfo ()

   Dumps information about signal connections, etc. for this object to
   the debug output.

   This function is useful for debugging, but does nothing if the library
   has been compiled in release mode (i.e. without debugging
   information).

   See also dumpObjectTree().

  void QObject::dumpObjectTree ()

   Dumps a tree of children to the debug output.

   This function is useful for debugging, but does nothing if the library
   has been compiled in release mode (i.e. without debugging
   information).

   See also dumpObjectInfo().

  bool QObject::event ( QEvent * e )   [virtual]

   This virtual function receives events to an object and should return
   true if the event e was recognized and processed.

   The event() function can be reimplemented to customize the behavior of
   an object.

   See also installEventFilter(), timerEvent(),
   QApplication::sendEvent(), QApplication::postEvent(), and
   QWidget::event().

  bool QObject::eventFilter ( QObject * watched, QEvent * event )   [virtual]

   Filters events if this object has been installed as an event filter
   for the watched object.

   In your reimplementation of this function, if you want to filter the
   event out, i.e. stop it being handled further, return true; otherwise
   return false.

   Example:
    class MainWindow : public QMainWindow
    {
    public:
        MainWindow();

    protected:
        bool eventFilter(QObject *obj, QEvent *ev);

    private:
        QTextEdit *textEdit;
    };

    MainWindow::MainWindow()
    {
        textEdit = new QTextEdit;
        setCentralWidget(textEdit);

        textEdit->installEventFilter(this);
    }

    bool MainWindow::eventFilter(QObject *obj, QEvent *event)
    {
        if (obj == textEdit) {
            if (event->type() == QEvent::KeyPress) {
                qDebug("Ate key press");
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            // pass the event on to the parent class
            return QMainWindow::eventFilter(obj, event);
        }
    }

   Notice in the example above that unhandled events are passed to the
   base class's eventFilter() function, since the base class might have
   reimplemented eventFilter() for its own internal purposes.

   Warning: If you delete the receiver object in this function, be sure
   to return true. Otherwise, Qt will forward the event to the deleted
   object and the program might crash.

   See also installEventFilter().

  T QObject::findChild ( const QString & name = QString() ) const

   Returns the child of this object that can be casted into type T and
   that is called name, or 0 if there is no such object. An empty string
   matches all object names. The search is performed recursively.

   If there is more than one child matching the search, the most direct
   ancestor is returned. If there are several direct ancestors, it is
   undefined which one will be returned. In that case, findChildren()
   should be used.

   This example returns a child QPushButton of parentWidget named
   "button1":
    QPushButton *button = parentWidget->findChild<QPushButton *>("button1");

   This example returns a QListWidget child of parentWidget:
    QListWidget *list = parentWidget->findChild<QListWidget *>();

   Warning: This function is not available with MSVC 6. Use qFindChild()
   instead if you need to support that version of the compiler.

   See also findChildren() and qFindChild().

  QList<T> QObject::findChildren ( const QString & name = QString() ) const

   Returns all children of this object with the given name that can be
   cast to type T, or an empty list if there are no such objects. An
   empty string matches all object names. The search is performed
   recursively.

   The following example shows how to find a list of child QWidgets of
   the specified parentWidget named widgetname:
    QList<QWidget *> widgets = parentWidget.findChildren<QWidget *>("widgetname
");

   This example returns all QPushButtons that are children of
   parentWidget:
    QList<QPushButton *> allPButtons = parentWidget.findChildren<QPushButton *>
();

   Warning: This function is not available with MSVC 6. Use
   qFindChildren() instead if you need to support that version of the
   compiler.

   See also findChild() and qFindChildren().

  QList<T> QObject::findChildren ( const QRegExp & regExp ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the children of this object that can be casted to type T and
   that have names matching the regular expression regExp, or an empty
   list if there are no such objects. The search is performed
   recursively.

   Warning: This function is not available with MSVC 6. Use
   qFindChildren() instead if you need to support that version of the
   compiler.

  bool QObject::inherits ( const char * className ) const

   Returns true if this object is an instance of a class that inherits
   className or a QObject subclass that inherits className; otherwise
   returns false.

   A class is considered to inherit itself.

   Example:
    QTimer *timer = new QTimer;         // QTimer inherits QObject
    timer->inherits("QTimer");          // returns true
    timer->inherits("QObject");         // returns true
    timer->inherits("QAbstractButton"); // returns false

    // QLayout inherits QObject and QLayoutItem
    QLayout *layout = new QLayout;
    layout->inherits("QObject");        // returns true
    layout->inherits("QLayoutItem");    // returns false

   (QLayoutItem is not a QObject.)

   Consider using qobject_cast<Type *>(object) instead. The method is
   both faster and safer.

   See also metaObject() and qobject_cast().

  void QObject::installEventFilter ( QObject * filterObj )

   Installs an event filter filterObj on this object. For example:
    monitoredObj->installEventFilter(filterObj);

   An event filter is an object that receives all events that are sent to
   this object. The filter can either stop the event or forward it to
   this object. The event filter filterObj receives events via its
   eventFilter() function. The eventFilter() function must return true if
   the event should be filtered, (i.e. stopped); otherwise it must return
   false.

   If multiple event filters are installed on a single object, the filter
   that was installed last is activated first.

   Here's a KeyPressEater class that eats the key presses of its
   monitored objects:
        class KeyPressEater : public QObject
        {
            Q_OBJECT
            ...

        protected:
            bool eventFilter(QObject *obj, QEvent *event);
        };

        bool KeyPressEater::eventFilter(QObject *obj, QEvent *event)
        {
            if (event->type() == QEvent::KeyPress) {
                QKeyEvent *keyEvent = static_cast<QKeyEvent *>(event);
                qDebug("Ate key press %d", keyEvent->key());
                return true;
            } else {
                // standard event processing
                return QObject::eventFilter(obj, event);
            }
        }

   And here's how to install it on two widgets:
        KeyPressEater *keyPressEater = new KeyPressEater(this);
        QPushButton *pushButton = new QPushButton(this);
        QListView *listView = new QListView(this);

        pushButton->installEventFilter(keyPressEater);
        listView->installEventFilter(keyPressEater);

   The QShortcut class, for example, uses this technique to intercept
   shortcut key presses.

   Warning: If you delete the receiver object in your eventFilter()
   function, be sure to return true. If you return false, Qt sends the
   event to the deleted object and the program will crash.

   See also removeEventFilter(), eventFilter(), and event().

  bool QObject::isWidgetType () const

   Returns true if the object is a widget; otherwise returns false.

   Calling this function is equivalent to calling inherits("QWidget"),
   except that it is much faster.

  void QObject::killTimer ( int id )

   Kills the timer with timer identifier, id.

   The timer identifier is returned by startTimer() when a timer event is
   started.

   See also timerEvent() and startTimer().

  const QMetaObject * QObject::metaObject () const   [virtual]

   Returns a pointer to the meta object of this object.

   A meta object contains information about a class that inherits
   QObject, e.g. class name, superclass name, properties, signals and
   slots. Every class that contains the Q_OBJECT macro will also have a
   meta object.

   The meta object information is required by the signal/slot connection
   mechanism and the property system. The inherits() function also makes
   use of the meta object.

  void QObject::moveToThread ( QThread * targetThread )

   Changes this object's thread affinity. Event processing for this
   object will continue in the targetThread. If targetThread is zero,
   only posted events are processed by the main thread; all other event
   processing for this object stops.

   Warning: This function is not thread-safe; the current thread must be
   same as the current thread affinity. In other words, this function can
   only "push" an object from the current thread to another thread, it
   cannot "pull" an object from any arbitrary thread to the current
   thread.

   See also thread().

  QObject * QObject::parent () const

   Returns a pointer to the parent object.

   See also children().

  QVariant QObject::property ( const char * name ) const

   Returns the value of the object's name property.

   If no such property exists, the returned variant is invalid.

   Information about all available properties is provided through the
   metaObject().

   See also setProperty(), QVariant::isValid(), and metaObject().

  int QObject::receivers ( const char * signal ) const   [protected]

   Returns the number of receivers connect to the signal.

   When calling this function, you can use the SIGNAL() macro to pass a
   specific signal:
    if (receivers(SIGNAL(valueChanged(QByteArray))) > 0) {
        QByteArray data;
        get_the_value(&data);       // expensive operation
        emit valueChanged(data);
    }

   As the code snippet above illustrates, you can use this function to
   avoid emitting a signal that nobody listens to.

   Warning: This function violates the object-oriented principle of
   modularity. However, it might be useful when you need to perform
   expensive initialization only if something is connected to a signal.

  void QObject::removeEventFilter ( QObject * obj )

   Removes an event filter object obj from this object. The request is
   ignored if such an event filter has not been installed.

   All event filters for this object are automatically removed when this
   object is destroyed.

   It is always safe to remove an event filter, even during event filter
   activation (i.e. from the eventFilter() function).

   See also installEventFilter(), eventFilter(), and event().

  QObject * QObject::sender () const   [protected]

   Returns a pointer to the object that sent the signal, if called in a
   slot activated by a signal; otherwise it returns 0. The pointer is
   valid only during the execution of the slot that calls this function.

   The pointer returned by this function becomes invalid if the sender is
   destroyed, or if the slot is disconnected from the sender's signal.

   Warning: This function violates the object-oriented principle of
   modularity. However, getting access to the sender might be useful when
   many signals are connected to a single slot. The sender is undefined
   if the slot is called as a normal C++ function.

  void QObject::setParent ( QObject * parent )

   Makes the object a child of parent.

   See also QWidget::setParent().

  bool QObject::setProperty ( const char * name, const QVariant & value )

   Sets the value of the obj1ect's name property to value.

   Returns true if the operation was successful; otherwise returns false.

   Information about all available properties is provided through the
   metaObject().

   See also property() and metaObject().

  bool QObject::signalsBlocked () const

   Returns true if signals are blocked; otherwise returns false.

   Signals are not blocked by default.

   See also blockSignals().

  int QObject::startTimer ( int interval )

   Starts a timer and returns a timer identifier, or returns zero if it
   could not start a timer.

   A timer event will occur every interval milliseconds until killTimer()
   is called. If interval is 0, then the timer event occurs once every
   time there are no more window system events to process.

   The virtual timerEvent() function is called with the QTimerEvent event
   parameter class when a timer event occurs. Reimplement this function
   to get timer events.

   If multiple timers are running, the QTimerEvent::timerId() can be used
   to find out which timer was activated.

   Example:
    class MyObject : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT

    public:
        MyObject(QObject *parent = 0);

    protected:
        void timerEvent(QTimerEvent *event);
    };

    MyObject::MyObject(QObject *parent)
        : QObject(parent)
    {
        startTimer(50);     // 50-millisecond timer
        startTimer(1000);   // 1-second timer
        startTimer(60000);  // 1-minute timer
    }

    void MyObject::timerEvent(QTimerEvent *event)
    {
        qDebug() << "Timer ID:" << event->timerId();
    }

   Note that QTimer's accuracy depends on the underlying operating system
   and hardware. Most platforms support an accuracy of 20 milliseconds;
   some provide more. If Qt is unable to deliver the requested number of
   timer events, it will silently discard some.

   The QTimer class provides a high-level programming interface with
   single-shot timers and timer signals instead of events. There is also
   a QBasicTimer class that is more lightweight than QTimer and less
   clumsy than using timer IDs directly.

   See also timerEvent(), killTimer(), and QTimer::singleShot().

  QThread * QObject::thread () const

   Returns the thread in which the object lives.

   See also moveToThread().

  void QObject::timerEvent ( QTimerEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive timer
   events for the object.

   QTimer provides a higher-level interface to the timer functionality,
   and also more general information about timers. The timer event is
   passed in the event parameter.

   See also startTimer(), killTimer(), and event().

  QString QObject::tr ( const char * sourceText, const char * comment )
  [static]

   Returns a translated version of sourceText, or sourceText itself if
   there is no appropriate translated version. The translation context is
   Object with comment (0 by default). All Object subclasses using the
   Q_OBJECT macro automatically have a reimplementation of this function
   with the subclass name as context.

   Warning: This method is reentrant only if all translators are
   installed before calling this method. Installing or removing
   translators while performing translations is not supported. Doing so
   will probably result in crashes or other undesirable behavior.

   See also trUtf8(), QApplication::translate(), and Internationalization
   with Qt.

  QString QObject::trUtf8 ( const char * sourceText, const char * comment )
  [static]

   Returns a translated version of sourceText, or
   QString::fromUtf8(sourceText) if there is no appropriate version. It
   is otherwise identical to tr(sourceText, comment).

   Warning: This method is reentrant only if all translators are
   installed before calling this method. Installing or removing
   translators while performing translations is not supported. Doing so
   will probably result in crashes or other undesirable behavior.

   See also tr() and QApplication::translate().

Related Non-Members

  T qFindChild ( const QObject * obj, const QString & name )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This function is equivalent to obj->findChild<T>(name). It is provided
   as a work-around for MSVC 6, which doesn't support member template
   functions.

   See also QObject::findChild().

  QList<T> qFindChildren ( const QObject * obj, const QString & name )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This function is equivalent to obj->findChildren<T>(name). It is
   provided as a work-around for MSVC 6, which doesn't support member
   template functions.

   See also QObject::findChildren().

  QList<T> qFindChildren ( const QObject * obj, const QRegExp & regExp )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This function is equivalent to obj->findChildren<T>(regExp). It is
   provided as a work-around for MSVC 6, which doesn't support member
   template functions.

  T qobject_cast ( QObject * object )

   Returns the given object cast to type T if the object is of type T (or
   of a subclass); otherwise returns 0.

   A class is considered to inherit itself.

   Example:
    QObject *obj = new QTimer;          // QTimer inherits QObject

    QTimer *timer = qobject_cast<QTimer *>(obj);
    // timer == (QObject *)obj

    QAbstractButton *button = qobject_cast<QAbstractButton *)(obj);
    // button == 0

   The qobject_cast() function behaves similarly to the standard C++
   dynamic_cast(), with the advantages that it doesn't require RTTI
   support and it works across dynamic library boundaries.

   qobject_cast() can also be used in conjunction with interfaces; see
   the Plug & Paint example for details.

   See also QObject::inherits().

Macro Documentation

  Q_CLASSINFO ( Name, Value )

   This macro associates extra information to the class, which is
   available using QObject::metaObject(). Except for the ActiveQt
   extension, Qt doesn't use this information.

   The extra information takes the form of a Name string and a Value
   literal string.

   Example:
    class MyClass : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT
        Q_CLASSINFO("Author", "Pierre Gendron")
        Q_CLASSINFO("URL", "http://www.my-organization.qc.ca")

    public:
        ...
    };

   See also QMetaObject::classInfo().

  Q_ENUMS ( ... )

   This macro registers one or several enum types to the meta-object
   system.

   Example:
    Q_ENUMS(Option AlignmentFlag EditMode TransformationMode)

   See also Qt's Property System.

  Q_FLAGS ( ... )

   This macro registers one or several "flags" types to the meta-object
   system.

   Example:
    Q_FLAGS(Options Alignment)

   See also Qt's Property System.

  Q_INTERFACES ( ... )

   This macro tells Qt which interfaces the class implements. This is
   used when implementing plugins.

   Example:
    class BasicToolsPlugin : public QObject,
                             public BrushInterface,
                             public ShapeInterface,
                             public FilterInterface
    {
        Q_OBJECT
        Q_INTERFACES(BrushInterface ShapeInterface FilterInterface)

    public:
        ...
    };

   See the Plug & Paint Basic Tools example for details.

   See also Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(), Q_EXPORT_PLUGINS(), and How to Create
   Qt Plugins.

  Q_PROPERTY ( ... )

   This macro declares a QObject property. The syntax is:
    Q_PROPERTY(type name
               READ getFunction
               [WRITE setFunction]
               [RESET resetFunction]
               [DESIGNABLE bool]
               [SCRIPTABLE bool]
               [STORED bool])
