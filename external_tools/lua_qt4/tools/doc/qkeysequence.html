Detailed Description

   The QKeySequence class encapsulates a key sequence as used by
   shortcuts.

   A key sequence consists of up to four keyboard codes, each optionally
   combined with modifiers, such as Qt::SHIFT, Qt::CTRL, Qt::ALT or
   Qt::META. For example, Qt::CTRL + Qt::Key_P might be a sequence used
   as a shortcut for printing a document. Valid codes for keys and
   modifiers are listed in Qt::Key and Qt::Modifier. As an alternative,
   use the unicode code point of the character; for example, 'A' gives
   the same key sequence as Qt::Key_A.

   Key sequences can be constructed either from an integer key code, or
   from a human readable translatable string such as "Ctrl+X,Alt+Space".
   A key sequence can be cast to a QString to obtain a human readable
   translated version of the sequence. Translations are done in the
   "QShortcut" context.

   In code that does not inherit the Qt namespace class, you must include
   the namespace when writing keycodes; for example, instead of
   Qt::ALT+Qt::Key_Q you would write Qt::ALT+Qt::Key_Q.

   See also QShortcut.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QKeySequence::SequenceMatch

   Constant Value Description
   QKeySequence::NoMatch 0 The key sequences are different; not even
   partially matching.
   QKeySequence::PartialMatch 1 The key sequences match partially, but
   are not the same.
   QKeySequence::ExactMatch 2 The key sequences are the same.

Member Function Documentation

  QKeySequence::QKeySequence ()

   Constructs an empty key sequence.

  QKeySequence::QKeySequence ( const QString & key )

   Creates a key sequence from the key string. For example "Ctrl+O" gives
   CTRL+'O'. The strings "Ctrl", "Shift", "Alt" and "Meta" are
   recognized, as well as their translated equivalents in the "QShortcut"
   context (using QObject::tr()).

   Up to four key codes may be entered by separating them with commas,
   e.g. "Alt+X,Ctrl+S,Q".

   This contructor is typically used with tr(), so that shortcut keys can
   be replaced in translations:
    QMenu *file = new QMenu(this);
    file->addAction(tr("&Open..."), this, SLOT(open()),
                      QKeySequence(tr("Ctrl+O", "File|Open")));

   Note the "File|Open" translator comment. It is by no means necessary,
   but it provides some context for the human translator.

  QKeySequence::QKeySequence ( int k1, int k2 = 0, int k3 = 0, int k4 = 0 )

   Constructs a key sequence with up to 4 keys k1, k2, k3 and k4.

   The key codes are listed in Qt::Key and can be combined with modifiers
   (see Qt::Modifier) such as Qt::SHIFT, Qt::CTRL, Qt::ALT or Qt::META.

  QKeySequence::QKeySequence ( const QKeySequence & keysequence )

   Copy constructor. Makes a copy of keysequence.

  QKeySequence::~QKeySequence ()

   Destroys the key sequence.

  uint QKeySequence::count () const

   Returns the number of keys in the key sequence. The maximum is 4.

  bool QKeySequence::isEmpty () const

   Returns true if the key sequence is empty; otherwise returns false.

  SequenceMatch QKeySequence::matches ( const QKeySequence & seq ) const

   Matches the sequence with seq. Returns ExactMatch if successful,
   PartialMatch if seq matches incompletely, and NoMatch if the sequences
   have nothing in common. Returns NoMatch if seq is shorter.

  QKeySequence QKeySequence::mnemonic ( const QString & text )   [static]

   Returns the shortcut key sequence for the mnemonic in text, or an
   empty key sequence if no mnemonics are found.

   For example, mnemonic("E&amp;xit") returns Qt::ALT+Qt::Key_X,
   mnemonic("&amp;Quit") returns ALT+Key_Q, and mnemonic("Quit") returns
   an empty QKeySequence.

   We provide a list of common mnemonics in English. At the time of
   writing, Microsoft and Open Group do not appear to have issued
   equivalent recommendations for other languages.

  QKeySequence::operator QString () const

   Creates a shortcut string for the key sequence.

   For example, the value Qt::CTRL+Qt::Key_O results in "Ctrl+O". If the
   key sequence has multiple key codes, each is separated by commas in
   the string returned, such as "Alt+X, Ctrl+Y, Z". The strings, "Ctrl",
   "Shift", etc. are translated using QObject::tr() in the "QShortcut"
   scope.

   If the key sequence has no keys, an empty string is returned.

   On Mac OS X, the string returned resembles the sequence that is shown
   in the menubar.

  QKeySequence::operator QVariant () const

   Returns the key sequence as a QVariant

  bool QKeySequence::operator!= ( const QKeySequence & other ) const

   Returns true if this key sequence is not equal to the other key
   sequence; otherwise returns false.

  bool QKeySequence::operator< ( const QKeySequence & other ) const

   Provides an arbitrary comparison of this key sequence and other key
   sequence. All that is guaranteed is that the operator returns false if
   both key sequences are equal and that (ks1 < ks2) == !( ks2 < ks1) if
   the key sequences are not equal.

   This function is useful in some circumstances, for example if you want
   to use QKeySequence objects as keys in a QMap.

   See also operator==(), operator!=(), operator>(), operator<=(), and
   operator>=().

  bool QKeySequence::operator<= ( const QKeySequence & other ) const

   Returns true if this key sequence is smaller or equal to the other key
   sequence; otherwise returns false.

   See also operator==(), operator!=(), operator<(), operator>(), and
   operator>=().

  QKeySequence & QKeySequence::operator= ( const QKeySequence & other )

   Assignment operator. Assigns the other key sequence to this object.

  bool QKeySequence::operator== ( const QKeySequence & other ) const

   Returns true if this key sequence is equal to the other key sequence;
   otherwise returns false.

  bool QKeySequence::operator> ( const QKeySequence & other ) const

   Returns true if this key sequence is larger than the other key
   sequence; otherwise returns false.

   See also operator==(), operator!=(), operator<(), operator<=(), and
   operator>=().

  bool QKeySequence::operator>= ( const QKeySequence & other ) const

   Returns true if this key sequence is larger or equal to the other key
   sequence; otherwise returns false.

   See also operator==(), operator!=(), operator<(), operator>(), and
   operator<=().

  int QKeySequence::operator[] ( uint index ) const

   Returns a reference to the element at position index in the key
   sequence. This can only be used to read an element.

Related Non-Members

  QDataStream & operator<< ( QDataStream & stream, const QKeySequence &
  sequence )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Writes the key sequence to the stream.

   See also Format of the QDataStream operators.

  QDataStream & operator>> ( QDataStream & stream, QKeySequence & sequence )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Reads a key sequence from the stream into the key sequence.

   See also Format of the QDataStream operators.
