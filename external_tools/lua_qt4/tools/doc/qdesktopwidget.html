Detailed Description

   The QDesktopWidget class provides access to screen information on
   multi-head systems.

   Systems with more than one graphics card and monitor can manage the
   physical screen space available either as multiple desktops, or as a
   large virtual desktop, which usually has the size of the bounding
   rectangle of all the screens (see isVirtualDesktop()). For an
   application, one of the available screens is the primary screen, i.e.
   the screen where the main widget resides (see primaryScreen()). All
   windows opened in the context of the application should be constrained
   to the boundaries of the primary screen; for example, it would be
   inconvenient if a dialog box popped up on a different screen, or split
   over two screens.

   The QDesktopWidget provides information about the geometry of the
   available screens with screenGeometry(). The number of screens
   available is returned by numScreens(). The screen number that a
   particular point or widget is located in is returned by
   screenNumber().

   Widgets provided by Qt use this class, for example, to place tooltips,
   menus and dialog boxes according to the parent or application widget.

   Applications can use this class to save window positions, or to place
   child widgets on one screen.

                         Managing Multiple Screens

   In the illustration above, Application One's primary screen is screen
   0, and App Two's primary screen is screen 1.

   See also QApplication and QX11Info::appRootWindow().

Member Function Documentation

  QDesktopWidget::QDesktopWidget ()

   Creates the desktop widget.

   If the system supports a virtual desktop, this widget will have the
   size of the virtual desktop; otherwise this widget will have the size
   of the primary screen.

   Instead of using QDesktopWidget directly, use QApplication::desktop().

  QDesktopWidget::~QDesktopWidget ()

   Destroy the object and free allocated resources.

  const QRect QDesktopWidget::availableGeometry ( int screen = -1 ) const

   Returns the available geometry of the screen with index screen. What
   is available will be subrect of screenGeometry() based on what the
   platform decides is available (for example excludes the Qt::Dock and
   menu bar on Mac OS X, or the taskbar on Windows).

   See also screenNumber() and screenGeometry().

  const QRect QDesktopWidget::availableGeometry ( const QWidget * widget )
  const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the available geometry of the screen which contains widget.

   See also screenGeometry().

  const QRect QDesktopWidget::availableGeometry ( const QPoint & p ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the available geometry of the screen which contains p.

   See also screenGeometry().

  bool QDesktopWidget::isVirtualDesktop () const

   Returns true if the system manages the available screens in a virtual
   desktop; otherwise returns false.

   For virtual desktops, screen() will always return the same widget. The
   size of the virtual desktop is the size of this desktop widget.

  int QDesktopWidget::numScreens () const

   Returns the number of available screens.

   See also primaryScreen().

  int QDesktopWidget::primaryScreen () const

   Returns the index of the primary screen.

   See also numScreens().

  void QDesktopWidget::resized ( int screen )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the size of screen changes.

  QWidget * QDesktopWidget::screen ( int screen = -1 )

   Returns a widget that represents the screen with index screen.

   If the system uses a virtual desktop, the returned widget will have
   the geometry of the entire virtual desktop i.e. bounding every screen.

   See also primaryScreen(), numScreens(), and isVirtualDesktop().

  const QRect QDesktopWidget::screenGeometry ( int screen = -1 ) const

   Returns the geometry of the screen with index screen.

   See also screenNumber().

  const QRect QDesktopWidget::screenGeometry ( const QWidget * widget ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the geometry of the screen which contains widget.

  const QRect QDesktopWidget::screenGeometry ( const QPoint & p ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the geometry of the screen which contains p.

  int QDesktopWidget::screenNumber ( const QWidget * widget = 0 ) const

   Returns the index of the screen that contains the largest part of
   widget, or -1 if the widget not on a screen.

   See also primaryScreen().

  int QDesktopWidget::screenNumber ( const QPoint & point ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the index of the screen that contains point, or -1 if no
   screen contains the point.

   See also primaryScreen().

  void QDesktopWidget::workAreaResized ( int screen )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the work area available on screen changes.
