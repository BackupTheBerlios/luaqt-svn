Detailed Description

   The QList class is a template class that provides lists.

   QList<T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It stores a list of
   values and provides fast index-based access as well as fast insertions
   and removals.

   QList<T>, QLinkedList<T>, and QVector<T> provide similar
   functionality. Here's an overview:
     * For most purposes, QList is the right class to use. Its
       index-based API is more convenient than QLinkedList's
       iterator-based API, and it is usually faster than QVector because
       of the way it stores its items in memory. It also expands to less
       code in your executable.
     * If you need a real linked list, with guarantees of constant time
       insertions in the middle of the list and iterators to items rather
       than indexes, use QLinkedList.
     * If you want the items to occupy adjacent memory positions, use
       QVector.

   Internally, QList<T> is represented as an array of pointers to items.
   (Exceptionally, if T is a pointer type, a basic type of the size of a
   pointer, or one of Qt's shared classes, QList<T> stores the item
   directly in the pointer.) For lists under a thousand items, this
   representation allows for very fast insertions in the middle, in
   addition to instantaneous index-based access. Furthermore, operations
   like prepend() and append() are very fast, because QList preallocates
   memory on both sides of its internal array.

   Here's an example of a QList that stores integers and a QList that
   stores QDate values:
    QList<int> integerList;
    QList<QDate> dateList;

   Qt includes a QStringList class that inherits QList<QString> and adds
   a few convenience functions, such as QStringList::join() and
   QStringList::find(). (QString::split() creates QStringLists from
   strings.)

   QList stores a list of items. The default constructor creates an empty
   list. To insert items into the list, you can use operator<<():
    QList<QString> list;
    list << "one" << "two" << "three";
    // list: ["one", "two", "three"]

   QList provides these basic functions to add, move, and remove items:
   insert(), replace(), removeAt(), move(), and swap(). In addition, it
   provides the following convenience functions: append(), prepend(),
   removeFirst(), and removeLast().

   QList uses 0-based indexes, just like C++ arrays. To access the item
   at a particular index position, you can use operator[](). On non-const
   lists, operator[]() returns a reference to the item and can be used on
   the left side of an assignment:
    if (list[0] == "Bob")
        list[0] = "Robert";

   Because QList is implemented as an array of pointers, this operation
   is very fast (constant time). For read-only access, an alternative
   syntax is to use at():
    for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); ++i) {
        if (list.at(i) == "Jane")
            cout << "Found Jane at position " << i << endl;
    }

   at() can be faster than operator[](), because it never causes a deep
   copy to occur.

   A common requirement is to remove an item from a list and do something
   with it. For this, QList provides takeAt(), takeFirst(), and
   takeLast(). Here's a loop that removes the items from a list one at a
   time and calls delete on them:
    QList<QWidget *> list;
    ...
    while (!list.isEmpty())
        delete list.takeFirst();

   Inserting and removing items at either ends of the list is very fast
   (constant time in most cases), because QList preallocates extra space
   on both sides of its internal buffer to allow for fast growth at both
   ends of the list.

   If you want to find all occurrences of a particular value in a list,
   use indexOf() or lastIndexOf(). The former searches forward starting
   from a given index position, the latter searches backward. Both return
   the index of a matching item if they find it; otherwise, they return
   -1. For example:
    int i = list.indexOf("Jane");
    if (i != -1)
        cout << "First occurrence of Jane is at position " << i << endl;

   If you simply want to check whether a list contains a particular
   value, use contains(). If you want to find out how many times a
   particular value occurs in the list, use count(). If you want to
   replace all occurrences of a particular value with another, use
   replace().

   QList's value type must be an assignable data type. This covers most
   data types that are commonly used, but the compiler won't let you, for
   example, store a QWidget as a value; instead, store a QWidget *. A few
   functions have additional requirements; for example, indexOf() and
   lastIndexOf() expect the value type to support operator==(). These
   requirements are documented on a per-function basis.

   Like the other container classes, QList provides Java-style iterators
   (QListIterator and QMutableListIterator) and STL-style iterators
   (QList::const_iterator and QList::iterator). In practice, these are
   rarely used, because you can use indexes into the QList. QList is
   implemented in such a way that direct index-based access is just as
   fast as using iterators.

   QList does not support inserting, prepending, appending or replacing
   with references to its own values. Doing so will cause your
   application to abort with an error message.

   See also QListIterator, QMutableListIterator, QLinkedList, and
   QVector.

Member Function Documentation

  QList::QList ()

   Constructs an empty list.

  QList::QList ( const QList & other )

   Constructs a copy of other.

   This operation takes constant time, because QList is implicitly
   shared. This makes returning a QList from a function very fast. If a
   shared instance is modified, it will be copied (copy-on-write), and
   that takes linear time.

   See also operator=().

  QList::~QList ()

   Destroys the list. References to the values in the list and all
   iterators of this list become invalid.

  void QList::append ( const T & value )

   Inserts value at the end of the list.

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list.append("one");
    list.append("two");
    list.append("three");
    // list: ["one", "two", "three"]

   This is the same as list.insert(size(), value).

   This operation is typically very fast (constant time), because QList
   preallocates extra space on both sides of its internal buffer to allow
   for fast growth at both ends of the list.

   See also operator<<(), prepend(), and insert().

  const T & QList::at ( int i ) const

   Returns the item at index position i in the list.

   i must be a valid index position in the list (i.e., 0 <= i < size()).

   This function is very fast (constant time).

   See also value() and operator[]().

   Example:
    std::list<double> stdlist;
    list.push_back(1.2);
    list.push_back(0.5);
    list.push_back(3.14);

    QList<double> list = QList<double>::fromStdList(stdlist);

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list << "A" << "B" << "C" << "B" << "A";
    list.indexOf("B");          // returns 1

    list.indexOf("B", 2);       // returns 3
    list.indexOf("X");          // returns -1

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also lastIndexOf() and contains().

  void QList::insert ( int i, const T & value )

   Inserts value at index position i in the list. If i is 0, the value is
   prepended to the list. If i is size(), the value is appended to the
   list.

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list << "alpha" << "beta" << "delta";
    list.insert(2, "gamma");
    // list: ["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta"]

   See also append(), prepend(), replace(), and removeAt().

  iterator QList::insert ( iterator before, const T & value )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Inserts value in front of the item pointed to by the iterator before.
   Returns an iterator pointing at the inserted item.

  bool QList::isEmpty () const

   assumes that the list isn't empty.

   See also first() and isEmpty().

  const T & QList::last () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  int QList::lastIndexOf ( const T & value, int from = -1 ) const

   Returns the index position of the last occurrence of value in the
   list, searching backward from index position from. If from is -1 (the
   default), the search starts at the last item. Returns -1 if no item
   matched.

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list << "A" << "B" << "C" << "B" << "A";
    list.lastIndexOf("B");      // returns 3
    list.lastIndexOf("B", 3);   // returns 3
    list.lastIndexOf("B", 2);   // returns 1
    list.lastIndexOf("X");      // returns -1

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also indexOf().

  QList<T> QList::mid ( int pos, int length = -1 ) const

   Returns a list whose elements are copied from this list, starting at
   position pos. If length is -1 (the default), all elements after pos
   are copied; otherwise length elements (or all remaining elements if
   there are less than length elements) are copied.

  void QList::move ( int from, int to )

   Moves the item at index position from to index position to.

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list << "A" << "B" << "C" << "D" << "E" << "F";
    list.move(1, 4);
    // list: ["A", "C", "D", "E", "B", "F"]

   This is the same as insert(to, takeAt(from)).

   See also swap(), insert(), and takeAt().

  void QList::pop_back ()

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   removeLast().

  void QList::pop_front ()

   This function is provided for STL compatibility. It is equivalent to
   removeFirst().

  void QList::prepend ( const T & value )

   Inserts value at the beginning of the list.

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list.prepend("one");
    list.prepend("two");
    list.prepend("three");
    // list: ["three", "two", "one"]

   This is the same as list.insert(0, value).

   This operation is usually very fast (constant time), because QList
   preallocates extra space on both sides of its internal buffer to allow
   for fast growth at both ends of the list.

   See also append() and insert().

   prepend(value).

  int QList::removeAll ( const T & value )

   Removes all occurrences of value in the list and returns the number of
   entries removed.

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list << "sun" << "cloud" << "sun" << "rain";
    list.removeAll("sun");
    // list: ["cloud", "rain"]

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also removeAt(), takeAt(), and replace().

  void QList::removeAt ( int i )

   Removes the item at index position i.

   i must be a valid index position in the list (i.e., 0 <= i < size()).

   See also takeAt(), removeFirst(), and removeLast().

  void QList::removeFirst ()

   Removes the first item in the list.

   This is the same as removeAt(0).

   See also removeAt() and takeFirst().

  void QList::removeLast ()

   Removes the last item in the list.

   See also removeAt() and takeLast().

  void QList::replace ( int i, const T & value )

   Replaces the item at index position i with value.

   i must be a valid index position in the list (i.e., 0 <= i < size()).

   See also operator[]() and removeAt().

  int QList::size () const

   Returns the number of items in the list.

   See also isEmpty() and count().

  void QList::swap ( int i, int j )

   Exchange the item at index position i with the item at index position
   j.

   Example:
    QList<QString> list;
    list << "A" << "B" << "C" << "D" << "E" << "F";
    list.swap(1, 4);
    // list: ["A", "E", "C", "D", "B", "F"]

   See also move().

  T QList::takeAt ( int i )

   Removes the item at index position i and returns it.

   i must be a valid index position in the list (i.e., 0 <= i < size()).

   If you don't use the return value, removeAt() is more efficient.

   See also removeAt(), takeFirst(), and takeLast().

  T QList::takeFirst ()

   Removes the first item in the list and returns it.

   This is the same as takeAt(0).

   This operation is very fast (constant time), because QList
   preallocates extra space on both sides of its internal buffer to allow
   for fast growth at both ends of the list.

   If you don't use the return value, removeFirst() is more efficient.

   See also takeLast(), takeAt(), and removeFirst().

  T QList::takeLast ()

   Removes the last item in the list and returns it.

   This is the same as takeAt(size() - 1).

   This operation is very fast (constant time), because QList
   preallocates extra space on both sides of its internal buffer to allow
   for fast growth at both ends of the list.

   If you don't use the return value, removeLast() is more efficient.

   See also takeFirst(), takeAt(), and removeLast().

  QSet<T> QList::toSet () const

   Returns a QSet object with the data contained in this QList. Since
   QSet doesn't allow duplicates, the resulting QSet might be smaller
   than the original list was.

   Example:
    QStringList list;
    list << "Julia" << "Mike" << "Mike" << "Julia" << "Julia";

    QSet<QString> set = list.toSet();
    set.contains("Julia");  // returns true
    set.contains("Mike");   // returns true
    set.size();             // returns 2

   See also toVector(), fromSet(), and QSet::fromList().

  std::list<T> QList::toStdList () const

   Returns a std::list object with the data contained in this QList.
   Example:
    QList<double> list;
    list << 1.2 << 0.5 << 3.14;

    std::list<double> stdlist = list.toStdList();

   See also fromStdList() and QVector::toStdVector().

  QVector<T> QList::toVector () const

   Returns a QVector object with the data contained in this QList.

   Example:
    QStringList list;
    list << "Sven" << "Kim" << "Ola";

    QVector<QString> vect = list.toVector();
    // vect: ["Sven", "Kim", "Ola"]

   See also toSet(), fromVector(), and QVector::fromList().

  T QList::value ( int i ) const

   Returns the value at index position i in the list.

   If the index i is out of bounds, the function returns a
   default-constructed value. If you are certain that the index is going
   to be within bounds, you can use at() instead, which is slightly
   faster.

   See also at() and operator[]().

  T QList::value ( int i, const T & defaultValue ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   If the index i is out of bounds, the function returns defaultValue.

  bool QList::operator!= ( const QList & other ) const

   Returns true if other is not equal to this list; otherwise returns
   false.

   Two lists are considered equal if they contain the same values in the
   same order.

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also operator==().

  QList QList::operator+ ( const QList & other ) const

   Returns a list that contains all the items in this list followed by
   all the items in the other list.

   See also operator+=().

  QList & QList::operator+= ( const QList & other )

   Appends the items of the other list to this list and returns a
   reference to this list.

   See also operator+() and append().

  QList & QList::operator+= ( const T & value )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Appends value to the list.

  QList & QList::operator<< ( const QList & other )

   Appends the items of the other list to this list and returns a
   reference to this list.

   See also operator+=() and append().

  QList & QList::operator<< ( const T & value )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Appends value to the list.

  QList & QList::operator= ( const QList & other )

   Assigns other to this list and returns a reference to this list.

  bool QList::operator== ( const QList & other ) const

   Returns true if other is equal to this list; otherwise returns false.

   Two lists are considered equal if they contain the same values in the
   same order.

   This function requires the value type to have an implementation of
   operator==().

   See also operator!=().

  T & QList::operator[] ( int i )

   Returns the item at index position i as a modifiable reference.

   i must be a valid index position in the list (i.e., 0 <= i < size()).

   This function is very fast (constant time).

   See also at() and value().

  const T & QList::operator[] ( int i ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Same as at().

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Reads a list from stream in into list.

   This function requires the value type to implement operator>>().
