Detailed Description

   The QPixmap class is an off-screen, pixel-based paint device.

   QPixmap is one of the three classes Qt provides for dealing with
   images, the others being QImage and QPicture. QPixmap is designed and
   optimized for drawing on screen; QImage is designed for I/O and for
   direct pixel access; QPicture provides a scalable, vectorial picture.
   There are (slow) functions to convert between QImage and QPixmap:
   toImage() and fromImage(). There's also a QIcon class that stores
   various versions of an icon.

   A common way to create a pixmap is to use the constructor that takes a
   file name. For example:
    label->setPixmap(QPixmap("paste.png"));

   The file name can either refer to an actual file on disk or to one of
   the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System overview
   for details on how to embed images and other resource files in the
   application's executable.

   Pixel data in a pixmap is internal and is managed by the underlying
   window system. Pixels can be accessed only through QPainter functions
   or by converting the QPixmap to a QImage.

   You can easily display a QPixmap on the screen using QLabel or one of
   QAbstractButton's subclasses (such as QPushButton and QToolButton).
   QLabel has a pixmap property, whereas QAbstractButton has an icon
   property.

   The QPixmap class uses implicit sharing, so you can pass QPixmap
   objects around by value.

   You can retrieve the width(), height(), depth(), and size() of a
   pixmap. The enclosing rectangle can be determined with rect(). Pixmaps
   can be filled with fill() and resized with resize(). You can create
   and set a mask with createHeuristicMask() and setMask(). Use
   selfMask() to see if the pixmap is identical to its mask.

   In addition to loading a pixmap from file using load() you can also
   loadFromData(). You can obtain a transformed version of the pixmap
   using transform().

   See also QBitmap, QImage, QImageReader, and Shared Classes.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QPixmap::HBitmapFormat

   This enum defines how the conversion between HBITMAP and QPixmap is
   performed.

   Warning: This enum is only available on Windows.

   Constant Value Description
   QPixmap::NoAlpha 0 The alpha channel is ignored and always treated as
   being set to fully opaque. This is preferred if the HBITMAP is used
   with standard GDI calls, such as BitBlt().
   QPixmap::PremultipliedAlpha 1 The HBITMAP is treated as having a alpha
   channel and premultiplied colors. This is preferred if the HBITMAP is
   accessed through the AlphaBlend() GDI function.

   See also fromWinHBITMAP() and toWinHBITMAP().

Member Function Documentation

  QPixmap::QPixmap ()

   Constructs a null pixmap.

   See also isNull().

  QPixmap::QPixmap ( int w, int h )

   Constructs a pixmap with w width, h height.

   The content of the pixmap is uninitialized.

   If either w or h is zero, a null pixmap is constructed.

   See also isNull().

  QPixmap::QPixmap ( const QString & fileName, const char * format = 0,
  Qt::ImageConversionFlags flags = Qt::AutoColor )

   Constructs a pixmap from the file with the given fileName. If the file
   does not exist or is of an unknown format, the pixmap becomes a null
   pixmap.

   The fileName, format and flags parameters are passed on to load().
   This means that the data in fileName is not compiled into the binary.
   If fileName contains a relative path (e.g. the filename only) the
   relevant file must be found relative to the runtime working directory.

   The file name can either refer to an actual file on disk or to one of
   the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System overview
   for details on how to embed images and other resource files in the
   application's executable.

   If the image needs to be modified to fit in a lower-resolution result
   (e.g. converting from 32-bit to 8-bit), use the flags to specify how
   you'd prefer this to happen.

   See also Qt::ImageConversionFlags, isNull(), load(), loadFromData(),
   save(), and QImageReader::imageFormat().

  QPixmap::QPixmap ( const char * const[] xpm )

   Constructs a pixmap from xpm, which must be a valid XPM image.

   Errors are silently ignored.

   Note that it's possible to squeeze the XPM variable a little bit by
   using an unusual declaration:
    static const char * const start_xpm[]={
        "16 15 8 1",
        "a c #cec6bd",
    ....

   The extra const makes the entire definition read-only, which is
   slightly more efficient (for example, when the code is in a shared
   library) and ROMable when the application is to be stored in ROM.

  QPixmap::QPixmap ( const QPixmap & pixmap )

   Constructs a pixmap that is a copy of pixmap.

  QPixmap::QPixmap ( const QSize & size )

   Constructs a pixmap of size size.

  QPixmap::~QPixmap ()

   Destroys the pixmap.

  QPixmap QPixmap::alphaChannel () const

   Returns the alpha channel of the pixmap. If the pixmap doesn't have an
   alpha channel a null pixmap is returned.

   See also hasAlphaChannel() and setAlphaChannel().

  QPixmap QPixmap::copy ( const QRect & rect = QRect() ) const

   Returns a deep copy of the subpart of the pixmap that is specified by
   rect.

   If rect is empty, the whole image is copied.

   See also operator=().

  QPixmap QPixmap::copy ( int x, int y, int w, int h ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a deep copy of the subpart of the pixmap that is specified by
   the rectangle x, y, w h.

   If the rectangle is empty, the whole image is copied.

  QBitmap QPixmap::createHeuristicMask ( bool clipTight = true ) const

   Creates and returns a heuristic mask for this pixmap. It works by
   selecting a color from one of the corners and then chipping away
   pixels of that color, starting at all the edges.

   The mask may not be perfect but it should be reasonable, so you can do
   things such as the following:
    pm->setMask(pm->createHeuristicMask());

   This function is slow because it involves transformation to a QImage,
   non-trivial computations and a transformation back to a QBitmap.

   If clipTight is true (the default) the mask is just large enough to
   cover the pixels; otherwise, the mask is larger than the data pixels.

   See also QImage::createHeuristicMask().

  QBitmap QPixmap::createMaskFromColor ( const QColor & maskColor ) const

   Creates and returns a mask for this pixmap based on maskColor.

   This function is slow because it involves transformation to a QImage
   and a transformation back to a QBitmap.

   See also createHeuristicMask().

  int QPixmap::defaultDepth ()   [static]

   Returns the default pixmap depth, i.e. the depth a pixmap gets if -1
   is specified.

   See also depth().

  int QPixmap::depth () const

   Returns the depth of the pixmap.

   The pixmap depth is also called bits per pixel (bpp) or bit planes of
   a pixmap. A null pixmap has depth 0.

   See also defaultDepth(), isNull(), and QImage::convertDepth().

  void QPixmap::detach ()

   This is a special-purpose function that detaches the pixmap from
   shared pixmap data.

   A pixmap is automatically detached by Qt whenever its contents are
   about to change. This is done in all QPixmap member functions that
   modify the pixmap (fill(), resize(), convertFromImage(), load(),
   etc.), and in QPainter::begin() on a pixmap.

   It is possible to modify a pixmap without letting Qt know. You can
   first obtain the system-dependent handle() and then call
   system-specific functions (for instance, BitBlt under Windows) that
   modify the pixmap contents. In such cases, you can call detach() to
   cut the pixmap loose from other pixmaps that share data with this one.

   detach() returns immediately if there is just a single reference or if
   the pixmap has not been initialized yet.

  void QPixmap::fill ( const QColor & fillColor = Qt::white )

   Fills the pixmap with the color fillColor.

  void QPixmap::fill ( const QWidget * widget, const QPoint & offset )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Fills the pixmap with the widget's background color or pixmap.

   The offset point is an offset in the widget.

   The point offset is a point in the widget's coordinate system. The
   pixmap's top-left pixel will be mapped to the point offset in the
   widget. This is significant if the widget has a background pixmap;
   otherwise the pixmap will simply be filled with the background color
   of the widget.

  void QPixmap::fill ( const QWidget * widget, int xoff, int yoff )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Fills the pixmap with the widget's background color or pixmap. xoff,
   yoff is an offset in the widget.

  QPixmap QPixmap::fromImage ( const QImage & img, Qt::ImageConversionFlags
  flags = Qt::AutoColor )   [static]

   Converts image img and sets this pixmap. Returns true if successful;
   otherwise returns false.

   The flags argument is a bitwise-OR of the Qt::ImageConversionFlags.
   Passing 0 for flags sets all the default options.

   If the image is a monochrome image, it is converted to a 32-bit pixmap
   and then filled with the colors in the color table. If this is too
   expensive an operation, you can use QBitmap::fromImage() instead.

   See also toImage(), isQBitmap(), QImage::convertDepth(),
   defaultDepth(), and QImage::hasAlphaBuffer().

  QPixmap QPixmap::fromWinHBITMAP ( HBITMAP bitmap, HBitmapFormat format =
  NoAlpha )   [static]

   Returns a QPixmap that is equivalent to the given bitmap which has the
   specified format.

   See also toWinHBITMAP().

  QPixmap QPixmap::grabWidget ( QWidget * widget, int x = 0, int y = 0, int w =
  -1, int h = -1 )   [static]

   Creates a pixmap and paints widget in it.

   If the widget has any children, then they are also painted in the
   appropriate positions.

   If you specify x, y, w or h, only the rectangle you specify is
   painted. The defaults are 0, 0 (top-left corner) and -1,-1 (which
   means the entire widget).

   (If w is negative, the function copies everything to the right border
   of the window. If h is negative, the function copies everything to the
   bottom of the window.)

   If widget is 0, or if the rectangle defined by x, y, the modified w
   and the modified h does not overlap the widget->rect(), this function
   will return a null QPixmap.

   This function actually asks widget to paint itself (and its children
   to paint themselves). QPixmap::grabWindow() grabs pixels off the
   screen, which is a bit faster and picks up exactly what's on-screen.
   This function works by calling paintEvent() with painter redirection
   turned on. If there are overlaying windows, grabWindow() will see
   them, but not this function.

   If there is overlap, it returns a pixmap of the size you want,
   containing a rendering of widget. If the rectangle you ask for is a
   superset of widget, the areas outside widget are covered with the
   widget's background.

   If an error occurs when trying to grab the widget, such as the size of
   the widget being too large to fit in memory, an isNull() pixmap is
   returned.

   See also grabWindow() and QWidget::paintEvent().

  QPixmap QPixmap::grabWidget ( QWidget * widget, const QRect & rect )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Creates a pixmap and paints widget in it. If the widget has any
   children, then they are also painted in the appropriate positions.

   If rect is a valid rectangle, only the rectangle you specify is
   painted.

   grabWidget(), QRect::isValid()

  QPixmap QPixmap::grabWindow ( WId window, int x = 0, int y = 0, int w = -1,
  int h = -1 )   [static]

   Grabs the contents of the window window and makes a pixmap out of it.
   Returns the pixmap.

   The arguments (x, y) specify the offset in the window, whereas (w, h)
   specify the width and height of the area to be copied.

   If w is negative, the function copies everything to the right border
   of the window. If h is negative, the function copies everything to the
   bottom of the window.

   Note that grabWindow() grabs pixels from the screen, not from the
   window. If there is another window partially or entirely over the one
   you grab, you get pixels from the overlying window, too.

   Note also that the mouse cursor is generally not grabbed.

   The reason we use a window identifier and not a QWidget is to enable
   grabbing of windows that are not part of the application, window
   system frames, and so on.

   Warning: Grabbing an area outside the screen is not safe in general.
   This depends on the underlying window system.

   Warning: X11 only: If window is not the same depth as the root window
   and another window partially or entirely obscures the one you grab,
   you will not get pixels from the overlying window. The contests of the
   obscured areas in the pixmap are undefined and uninitialized.

   See also grabWidget().

  bool QPixmap::hasAlpha () const

   Returns true this pixmap has an alpha channel or a mask.

   See also hasAlphaChannel() and mask().

  bool QPixmap::hasAlphaChannel () const

   Returns true if the pixmap has an alpha channel; otherwise it returns
   false.

   See also hasAlpha() and mask().

  int QPixmap::height () const

   Returns the height of the pixmap.

   See also width(), size(), and rect().

  bool QPixmap::isNull () const

   Returns true if this is a null pixmap; otherwise returns false.

   A null pixmap has zero width, zero height and no contents. You cannot
   draw in a null pixmap.

   Resizing an existing pixmap to (0, 0) makes a pixmap into a null
   pixmap.

   See also resize().

  bool QPixmap::isQBitmap () const

   Returns true if this is a QBitmap; otherwise returns false.

  bool QPixmap::load ( const QString & fileName, const char * format = 0,
  Qt::ImageConversionFlags flags = Qt::AutoColor )

   Loads a pixmap from the file fileName at runtime. Returns true if
   successful; otherwise returns false.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the pixmap using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (default), the loader
   reads a few bytes from the header to guess the file's format.

   If the data needs to be modified to fit in a lower-resolution result
   (e.g. converting from 32-bit to 8-bit), use the flags to specify how
   you'd prefer this to happen.

   The QImageReader documentation lists the supported image formats and
   explains how to add extra formats.

   The file name can either refer to an actual file on disk or to one of
   the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System overview
   for details on how to embed images and other resource files in the
   application's executable.

   QImageReader

   See also loadFromData(), save(), QImageReader::imageFormat(),
   QImage::load(), and fromImage().

  bool QPixmap::loadFromData ( const uchar * buf, uint len, const char * format
  = 0, Qt::ImageConversionFlags flags = Qt::AutoColor )

   Loads a pixmap from the binary data in buf (len bytes). Returns true
   if successful; otherwise returns false.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the pixmap using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (default), the loader
   reads a few bytes from the header to guess the file's format.

   If the data needs to be modified to fit in a lower-resolution result
   (e.g. converting from 32-bit to 8-bit), use the flags to specify how
   you'd prefer this to happen.

   The QImageReader documentation lists the supported image formats and
   explains how to add extra formats.

   See also load(), save(), QImageReader::imageFormat(),
   QImage::loadFromData(), fromImage(), and QImageReader.

  bool QPixmap::loadFromData ( const QByteArray & buf, const char * format = 0,
  Qt::ImageConversionFlags flags = Qt::AutoColor )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Loads a pixmap from the binary data buf.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the pixmap using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (default), the loader
   reads a few bytes from the header to guess the file's format.

   If the data needs to be modified to fit in a lower-resolution result
   (e.g. converting from 32-bit to 8-bit), use the flags to specify how
   you'd prefer this to happen.

  QBitmap QPixmap::mask () const

   Returns the mask, or a null bitmap if no mask has been set.

   See also setMask(), QBitmap, and hasAlpha().

  QRect QPixmap::rect () const

   Returns the enclosing rectangle (0,0,width(),height()) of the pixmap.

   See also width(), height(), and size().

  bool QPixmap::save ( const QString & fileName, const char * format, int
  quality = -1 ) const

   Saves the pixmap to the file fileName using the image file format
   format and a quality factor quality. quality must be in the range
   [0,100] or -1. Specify 0 to obtain small compressed files, 100 for
   large uncompressed files, and -1 to use the default settings. Returns
   true if successful; otherwise returns false.

   See also load(), loadFromData(), QImageReader::imageFormat(),
   QImage::save(), and QImageReader.

  bool QPixmap::save ( QIODevice * device, const char * format, int quality =
  -1 ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This function writes a QPixmap to the QIODevice, device using the
   image file format format. This can be used, for example, to save a
   pixmap directly into a QByteArray:
            QPixmap pixmap;
            QByteArray bytes;
            QBuffer buffer(&bytes);
            buffer.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly);
            pixmap.save(&buffer, "PNG"); // writes pixmap into bytes in PNG for
mat

   The quality parameter is a quality factor quality. quality must be in
   the range [0,100] or -1. Specify 0 to obtain small compressed files,
   100 for large uncompressed files, and -1 to use the default settings.

  QPixmap QPixmap::scaled ( int w, int h, Qt::AspectRatioMode aspectRatioMode =
  Qt::IgnoreAspectRatio, Qt::TransformationMode transformMode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a copy of the pixmap scaled to a rectangle of width w and
   height h according to aspectRatioMode and transformMode.
     * If aspectRatioMode is Qt::IgnoreAspectRatio, the pixmap is scaled
       to (w, h).
     * If aspectRatioMode is Qt::KeepAspectRatio, the pixmap is scaled to
       a rectangle as large as possible inside (w, h), preserving the
       aspect ratio.
     * If aspectRatioMode is Qt::KeepAspectRatioByExpanding, the pixmap
       is scaled to a rectangle as small as possible outside (w, h),
       preserving the aspect ratio.

   If either the width w or the height h is zero or negative, this
   function returns a null pixmap.

   See also scaledToWidth(), scaledToHeight(), and transformed().

  QPixmap QPixmap::scaled ( const QSize & size, Qt::AspectRatioMode aspectMode
  = Qt::IgnoreAspectRatio, Qt::TransformationMode transformMode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Scales the pixmap to the given size, using the aspect ratio and
   transformation modes specified by aspectMode and transformMode.

  QPixmap QPixmap::scaledToHeight ( int h, Qt::TransformationMode mode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a scaled copy of the pixmap using a transformation specified
   by mode. The returned pixmap has a height of h pixels. This function
   automatically calculates the width of the pixmap so that the ratio of
   the pixmap is preserved.

   If h is 0 or negative a null pixmap is returned.

   See also scaled(), scaledToWidth(), and transformed().

  QPixmap QPixmap::scaledToWidth ( int w, Qt::TransformationMode mode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a scaled copy of the pixmap using a transformation specified
   by mode. The returned pixmap has a width of w pixels. This function
   automatically calculates the height of the pixmap so that the ratio of
   the pixmap is preserved.

   If w is 0 or negative a null pixmap is returned.

   See also scaled(), scaledToHeight(), and transformed().

  int QPixmap::serialNumber () const

   Returns a number that uniquely identifies the contents of this QPixmap
   object. This means that multiple QPixmap objects can have the same
   serial number as long as they refer to the same contents.

   A null pixmap always have a serial number of 0.

   An example of where this is useful is for caching QPixmaps.

   See also QPixmapCache.

  void QPixmap::setAlphaChannel ( const QPixmap & alpha )

   Sets the alpha channel of this pixmap to alpha. If the pixmap already
   contains an alpha channel, it is merged with alpha.

  void QPixmap::setMask ( const QBitmap & newmask )

   Sets a mask bitmap.

   The newmask bitmap defines the clip mask for this pixmap. Every pixel
   in newmask corresponds to a pixel in this pixmap. Pixel value 1 means
   opaque and pixel value 0 means transparent. The mask must have the
   same size as this pixmap.

   Warning: Setting the mask on a pixmap will cause any alpha channel
   data to be cleared. For example:
            QPixmap alpha("image-with-alpha.png");
            QPixmap alphacopy = alpha;
            alphacopy.setMask(*alphacopy.mask());

   Now, alpha and alphacopy are visually different.

   Setting a null mask resets the mask.

   See also mask(), createHeuristicMask(), and QBitmap.

  QSize QPixmap::size () const

   Returns the size of the pixmap.

   See also width(), height(), and rect().

  QImage QPixmap::toImage () const

   Converts the pixmap to a QImage. Returns a null image if it fails.

   If the pixmap has 1-bit depth, the returned image will also be 1 bit
   deep. If the pixmap has 2- to 8-bit depth, the returned image has
   8-bit depth. If the pixmap has greater than 8-bit depth, the returned
   image has 32-bit depth.

   Note that for the moment, alpha masks on monochrome images are
   ignored.

   See also convertFromImage().

  HBITMAP QPixmap::toWinHBITMAP ( HBitmapFormat format = NoAlpha ) const

   Creates a HBITMAP equivalent to the QPixmap, based on the given
   format, and returns the HBITMAP handle.

   It is the caller's responsibility to free the HBITMAP data after use.

   Warning: This function is only available on Windows.

   See also fromWinHBITMAP().

  QPixmap QPixmap::transformed ( const QMatrix & matrix, Qt::TransformationMode
  mode = Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a copy of the pixmap that is transformed using matrix. The
   original pixmap is not changed.

   The transformation matrix is internally adjusted to compensate for
   unwanted translation, i.e. transformed() returns the smallest image
   that contains all the transformed points of the original image.

   mode specifies whether the transformation should be smooth or not.

   This function is slow because it involves transformation to a QImage,
   non-trivial computations and a transformation back to a QPixmap.

   See also trueMatrix(), QMatrix, QPainter::setWorldMatrix(), and
   QImage::transformed().

  QMatrix QPixmap::trueMatrix ( const QMatrix & m, int w, int h )   [static]

   Returns the actual matrix used for transforming a pixmap with w width
   and h height and matrix m.

   When transforming a pixmap with transform(), the transformation matrix
   is internally adjusted to compensate for unwanted translation, i.e.
   transform() returns the smallest pixmap containing all transformed
   points of the original pixmap.

   This function returns the modified matrix, which maps points correctly
   from the original pixmap into the new pixmap.

   See also transformed() and QMatrix.

  int QPixmap::width () const

   Returns the width of the pixmap.

   See also height(), size(), and rect().

  const QX11Info & QPixmap::x11Info () const

   Returns a pointer to a QX11Info object. This pointer is owned by
   QPixmap and should not be deleted.

  Qt::HANDLE QPixmap::x11PictureHandle () const

   Returns the X11 Picture handle of the pixmap for XRender support. Use
   of this function is not portable. This function will return 0 if
   XRender support is not compiled into Qt, if the XRender extension is
   not supported on the X11 display, or if the handle could not be
   created.

  QPixmap::operator QVariant () const

   Returns the pixmap as a QVariant

  bool QPixmap::operator! () const

   Returns true if this is a null pixmap; otherwise returns false.

   See also isNull().

  QPixmap & QPixmap::operator= ( const QPixmap & pixmap )

   Assigns the pixmap pixmap to this pixmap and returns a reference to
   this pixmap.

  QDataStream & operator>> ( QDataStream & s, QPixmap & pixmap )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Reads a pixmap from the stream s into the pixmap pixmap.
