Detailed Description

   The QXmlSimpleReader class provides an implementation of a simple XML
   parser.

   This XML reader is suitable for a wide range of applications. It is
   able to parse well-formed XML and can report the namespaces of
   elements to a content handler; however, it does not parse any external
   entities.

   The easiest pattern of use for this class is to create a reader
   instance, define an input source, specify the handlers to be used by
   the reader, and parse the data.

   For example, we could use a QFile to supply the input. Here, we create
   a reader, and define an input source to be used by the reader:
        QXmlSimpleReader xmlReader;
        QXmlInputSource *source = new QXmlInputSource(file);

   A handler lets us perform actions when the reader encounters certain
   types of content, or if errors in the input are found. The reader must
   be told which handler to use for each type of event. For many common
   applications, we can create a custom handler by subclassing
   QXmlDefaultHandler, and use this to handle both error and content
   events:
        Handler *handler = new Handler;
        xmlReader.setContentHandler(handler);
        xmlReader.setErrorHandler(handler);

   If you don't set at least the content and error handlers, the parser
   will fall back on its default behavior---and will do nothing.

   The most convenient way to handle the input is to read it in a single
   pass using the parse() function with an argument that specifies the
   input source:
        bool ok = xmlReader.parse(source);

        if (!ok)
            std::cout << "Parsing failed." << std::endl;

   If you can't parse the entire input in one go (for example, it is
   huge, or is being delivered over a network connection), data can be
   fed to the parser in pieces. This is achieved by telling parse() to
   work incrementally, and making subsequent calls to the parseContinue()
   function, until all the data has been processed.

   A common way to perform incremental parsing is to connect the
   readyRead() signal of the input source to a slot, and handle the
   incoming data there. For example, the following code shows how a
   parser for RSS feeds can be used to incrementally parse data that it
   receives from a QHttp object:
    void RSSListing::readData(const QHttpResponseHeader &resp)
    {
        bool ok;

        if (resp.statusCode() != 200)
            http.abort();
        else {
            xmlInput.setData(http.readAll());

            if (newInformation) {
                ok = xmlReader.parse(&xmlInput, true);
                newInformation = false;
            }
            else
                ok = xmlReader.parseContinue();

            if (!ok)
                http.abort();
        }
    }

   Aspects of the parsing behavior can be adapted using setFeature() and
   setProperty(). For example, the following code could be used to enable
   reporting of namespace prefixes to the content handler:
    xmlReader.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes", true
);

Member Function Documentation

  QXmlSimpleReader::QXmlSimpleReader ()

   Constructs a simple XML reader.

  QXmlSimpleReader::~QXmlSimpleReader ()   [virtual]

   Destroys the simple XML reader.

  bool QXmlSimpleReader::parse ( const QXmlInputSource * input, bool
  incremental )   [virtual]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Reads an XML document from input and parses it. Returns true if the
   parsing is completed successfully; otherwise returns false, indicating
   that an error occurred.

   If incremental is false, this function will return false if the XML
   file is not read completely. The parsing cannot be continued in this
   case.

   If incremental is true, the parser does not return false if it reaches
   the end of the input before reaching the end of the XML file. Instead,
   it stores the state of the parser so that parsing can be continued
   later when more data is available. In such a case, you can use the
   function parseContinue() to continue with parsing. This class stores a
   pointer to the input source input and the parseContinue() function
   tries to read from that input source. Therefore, you should not delete
   the input source input until you no longer need to call
   parseContinue().

   If this function is called with incremental set to true while an
   incremental parse is in progress, a new parsing session will be
   started, and the previous session will be lost.

   See also parseContinue() and QTcpSocket.

  bool QXmlSimpleReader::parseContinue ()   [virtual]

   Continues incremental parsing, taking input from the QXmlInputSource
   that was specified with the most recent call to parse(). To use this
   function, you must have called parse() with the incremental argument
   set to true.

   Returns false if a parsing error occurs; otherwise returns true, even
   if the end of the XML file has not been reached. You can continue
   parsing at a later stage by calling this function again when there is
   more data available to parse.

   Calling this function when there is no data available in the input
   source indicates to the reader that the end of the XML file has been
   reached. If the input supplied up to this point was not well-formed
   then a parsing error occurs, and false is returned. If the input
   supplied was well-formed, true is returned. It is important to end the
   input in this way because it allows you to reuse the reader to parse
   other XML files.

   Calling this function after the end of file has been reached, but
   without available data will cause false to be returned whether the
   previous input was well-formed or not.

   See also parse(), QXmlInputSource::data(), and
   QXmlInputSource::next().

  void QXmlSimpleReader::setFeature ( const QString & name, bool enable )
  [virtual]

   Turns on the feature name if enable is true; otherwise turns it off.

   The name parameter must be one of the following strings:

                           Feature Default Notes
   http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces true If enabled, namespaces are
                      reported to the content handler.
    http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes false If enabled, the
   original prefixed names and attributes used for namespace declarations
                               are reported.
   http://trolltech.com/xml/features/report-whitespace-only-CharData true
    If enabled, CharData that consist of only whitespace characters are
              reported using QXmlContentHandler::characters().
     http://trolltech.com/xml/features/report-start-end-entity false If
     enabled, the parser reports QXmlContentHandler::startEntity() and
     QXmlContentHandler::endEntity() events, so character data might be
     reported in chunks. If disabled, the parser does not report these
       events, but silently substitutes the entities, and reports the
                        character data in one chunk.

   More information about features can be found in the Qt SAX2 overview.

   Reimplemented from QXmlReader.
