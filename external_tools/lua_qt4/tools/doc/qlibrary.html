Detailed Description

   The QLibrary class loads shared libraries at runtime.

   An instance of a QLibrary object operates on a single shared object
   file (which we call a "library", but is also known as a "DLL"). A
   QLibrary provides access to the functionality in the library in a
   platform independent way. You can either pass a file name in the
   constructor, or set it explicitly with setFileName(). When loading the
   library, QLibrary searches in all the system-specific library
   locations (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix), unless the file name has an
   absolute path. If the file cannot be found, QLibrary tries the name
   with different platform-specific file suffixes, like ".so" on Unix,
   ".dylib" on the Mac, or ".dll" on Windows. This makes it possible to
   specify shared libraries that are only identified by their basename
   (i.e. without their suffix), so the same code will work on different
   operating systems.

   The most important functions are load() to dynamically load the
   library file, isLoaded() to check whether loading was successful, and
   resolve() to resolve a symbol in the library. The resolve() function
   implicitly tries to load the library if it has not been loaded yet.
   Multiple instances of QLibrary can be used to access the same physical
   library. Once loaded, libraries remain in memory until the application
   terminates. You can attempt to unload a library using unload(), but if
   other instances of QLibrary are using the same library, the call will
   fail, and unloading will only happen when every instance has called
   unload().

   A typical use of QLibrary is to resolve an exported symbol in a
   library, and to call the C function that this symbol represents. This
   is called "explicit linking" in contrast to "implicit linking", which
   is done by the link step in the build process when linking an
   executable against a library.

   The following code snippet loads a library, resolves the symbol
   "mysymbol", and calls the function if everything succeeded. If
   something goes wrong, e.g. the library file does not exist or the
   symbol is not defined, the function pointer will be 0 and won't be
   called.
    QLibrary myLib("mylib");
    typedef void (*MyPrototype)();
    MyPrototype myFunction = (MyPrototype) myLib.resolve("mysymbol");
    if (myFunction)
        myFunction();

   The symbol must be exported as a C function from the library for
   resolve() to work. This means that the function must be wrapped in an
   extern "C" block if the library is compiled with a C++ compiler. On
   Windows, this also requires the use of a dllexport macro; see
   resolve() for the details of how this is done. For convenience, there
   is a static resolve() function which you can use if you just want to
   call a function in a library without explicitly loading the library
   first:
    typedef void (*MyPrototype)();
    MyPrototype myFunction =
            (MyPrototype) QLibrary::resolve("mylib", "mysymbol");
    if (myFunction)
        myFunction();

   See also QPluginLoader.

Property Documentation

  fileName : QString

   This property holds the file name of the library.

   We recommend omitting the file's suffix in the file name, since
   QLibrary will automatically look for the file with the appropriate
   suffix (see isLibrary()).

   When loading the library, QLibrary searches in all system-specific
   library locations (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix), unless the file name
   has an absolute path. After loading the library successfully,
   fileName() returns the fully qualified file name of the library. For
   example, after successfully loading the "GL" library on unix,
   fileName() will return "libGL.so".

   Access functions:
     * QString fileName () const
     * void setFileName ( const QString & fileName )

Member Function Documentation

  QLibrary::QLibrary ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a library with the given parent.

  QLibrary::QLibrary ( const QString & fileName, QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a library object with the given parent that will load the
   library specified by fileName.

   We recommend omitting the file's suffix in fileName, since QLibrary
   will automatically look for the file with the appropriate suffix in
   accordance with the platform, e.g. ".so" on Unix, ".dylib" on Mac OS
   X, and ".dll" on Windows. (See fileName.)

  QLibrary::~QLibrary ()

   Destroys the QLibrary object.

   Unless unload() was called explicitly, the library stays in memory
   until the application terminates.

   See also isLoaded() and unload().

  bool QLibrary::isLibrary ( const QString & fileName )   [static]

   Returns true if fileName has a valid suffix for a loadable library;
   otherwise returns false.

                       Platform     Valid suffixes
                       Windows           .dll
                      Unix/Linux         .so
                         AIX              .a
                        HP-UX            .sl
                       Mac OS X  .dylib, .bundle, .so

   Trailing versioning numbers on Unix are ignored.

  bool QLibrary::isLoaded () const

   Returns true if the library is loaded; otherwise returns false.

   See also load().

  bool QLibrary::load ()

   Loads the library and returns true if the library was loaded
   successfully; otherwise returns false. Since resolve() always calls
   this function before resolving any symbols it is not necessary to call
   it explicitly. In some situations you might want the library loaded in
   advance, in which case you would use this function.

   On Darwin and Mac OS X this function uses code from dlcompat, part of
   the OpenDarwin project.

   See also unload().

  void * QLibrary::resolve ( const char * symbol )

   Returns the address of the exported symbol symbol. The library is
   loaded if necessary. The function returns 0 if the symbol could not be
   resolved or if the library could not be loaded.

   Example:
    typedef int (*AvgFunction)(int, int);

    AvgFunction avg = (AvgFunction) library->resolve("avg");
    if (avg)
        return avg(5, 8);
    else
        return -1;

   The symbol must be exported as a C function from the library. This
   means that the function must be wrapped in an extern "C" if the
   library is compiled with a C++ compiler. On Windows you must also
   explicitly export the function from the DLL using the
   __declspec(dllexport) compiler directive, for example:
    extern "C" MY_EXPORT int avg(int a, int b)
    {
        return (a + b) / 2;
    }

   with MY_EXPORT defined as
    #ifdef Q_WS_WIN
    #define MY_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
    #else
    #define MY_EXPORT
    #endif

   On Darwin and Mac OS X this function uses code from dlcompat, part of
   the OpenDarwin project.

  void * QLibrary::resolve ( const QString & fileName, const char * symbol )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Loads the library fileName and returns the address of the exported
   symbol symbol. Note that fileName should not include the
   platform-specific file suffix; (see fileName). The library remains
   loaded until the application exits.

   The function returns 0 if the symbol could not be resolved or if the
   library could not be loaded.

   See also resolve().

  bool QLibrary::unload ()

   Unloads the library and returns true if the library could be unloaded;
   otherwise returns false.

   This happens automatically on application termination, so you
   shouldn't normally need to call this function.

   If other instances of QLibrary are using the same library, the call
   will fail, and unloading will only happen when every instance has
   called unload().

   Note that on Mac OS X, dynamic libraries cannot be unloaded.

   See also resolve() and load().
