Detailed Description

   The QSpinBox class provides a spin box widget.

   QSpinBox is designed to handle integers and discrete sets of values
   (e.g., month names); use QDoubleSpinBox for floating point values.

   QSpinBox allows the user to choose a value by clicking the up/down
   buttons or pressing up/down on the keyboard to increase/decrease the
   value currently displayed. The user can also type the value in
   manually. If the value is entered directly into the spin box, the
   value will be changed and valueChanged() will be emitted with the new
   value when Enter/Return is pressed, when the spin box looses focus or
   when the spin box is deactivated (see
   QWidget::windowActivationChanged()). The spin box supports integer
   values but can be extended to use different strings with validate(),
   textFromValue() and valueFromText().

   Every time the value changes QSpinBox emits the valueChanged()
   signals. The current value can be fetched with value() and set with
   setValue().

   Clicking the up/down buttons or using the keyboard accelerator's up
   and down arrows will increase or decrease the current value in steps
   of size singleStep(). If you want to change this behaviour you can
   reimplement the virtual function stepBy(). The minimum and maximum
   value and the step size can be set using one of the constructors, and
   can be changed later with setMinimum(), setMaximum() and
   setSingleStep().

   Most spin boxes are directional, but QSpinBox can also operate as a
   circular spin box, i.e. if the range is 0-99 and the current value is
   99, clicking "up" will give 0 if wrapping() is set to true. Use
   setWrapping() if you want circular behavior.

   The displayed value can be prepended and appended with arbitrary
   strings indicating, for example, currency or the unit of measurement.
   See setPrefix() and setSuffix(). The text in the spin box is retrieved
   with text() (which includes any prefix() and suffix()), or with
   cleanText() (which has no prefix(), no suffix() and no leading or
   trailing whitespace).

   It is often desirable to give the user a special (often default)
   choice in addition to the range of numeric values. See
   setSpecialValueText() for how to do this with QSpinBox.

  Subclassing QSpinBox

   If using prefix(), suffix(), and specialValueText() don't provide
   enough control, you subclass QSpinBox and reimplement valueFromText()
   and textFromValue(). For example, here's the code for a custom spin
   box that allows the user to enter icon sizes (e.g., "32 x 32"):
    int IconSizeSpinBox::valueFromText(const QString &text) const
    {
        QRegExp regExp(tr("(\\d+)(\\s*[x×]\\s*\\d+)?"));

        if (regExp.exactMatch(text)) {
            return regExp.cap(1).toInt();
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    QString IconSizeSpinBox::textFromValue(int value) const
    {
        return tr("%1 × %1").arg(value);
    }

   See the Icons example for the full source code.

Property Documentation

  cleanText : const QString

   This property holds the text of the spin box excluding any prefix,
   suffix, or leading or trailing whitespace.

   Access functions:
     * QString cleanText () const

   See also text, QSpinBox::prefix, and QSpinBox::suffix.

  maximum : int

   This property holds the maximum value of the spin box.

   When setting this property the minimum is adjusted if necessary, to
   ensure that the range remains valid.

   The default maximum value is 99.

   Access functions:
     * int maximum () const
     * void setMaximum ( int max )

   See also setRange() and specialValueText.

  minimum : int

   This property holds the minimum value of the spin box.

   When setting this property the maximum is adjusted if necessary to
   ensure that the range remains valid.

   The default minimum value is 0.

   Access functions:
     * int minimum () const
     * void setMinimum ( int min )

   See also setRange() and specialValueText.

  prefix : QString

   This property holds the spin box's prefix.

   The prefix is prepended to the start of the displayed value. Typical
   use is to display a unit of measurement or a currency symbol. For
   example:
    sb->setPrefix("$");

   To turn off the prefix display, set this property to an empty string.
   The default is no prefix. The prefix is not displayed when value() ==
   minimum() and specialValueText() is set.

   If no prefix is set, prefix() returns an empty string.

   Access functions:
     * QString prefix () const
     * void setPrefix ( const QString & p )

   See also suffix(), setSuffix(), specialValueText(), and
   setSpecialValueText().

  singleStep : int

   This property holds the step value.

   When the user uses the arrows to change the spin box's value the value
   will be incremented/decremented by the amount of the singleStep. The
   default value is 1. Setting a singleStep value of less than 0 does
   nothing.

   Access functions:
     * int singleStep () const
     * void setSingleStep ( int val )

  suffix : QString

   This property holds the suffix of the spin box.

   The suffix is appended to the end of the displayed value. Typical use
   is to display a unit of measurement or a currency symbol. For example:
    sb->setSuffix(" km");

   To turn off the suffix display, set this property to an empty string.
   The default is no suffix. The suffix is not displayed for the
   minimum() if specialValueText() is set.

   If no suffix is set, suffix() returns an empty string.

   Access functions:
     * QString suffix () const
     * void setSuffix ( const QString & s )

   See also prefix(), setPrefix(), specialValueText(), and
   setSpecialValueText().

  value : int

   This property holds the value of the spin box.

   setValue() will emit valueChanged() if the new value is different from
   the old one.

   Access functions:
     * int value () const
     * void setValue ( int val )

Member Function Documentation

  QSpinBox::QSpinBox ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a spin box with no minimum and maximum values, a step value
   of 1. The value is initially set to 0. It is parented to parent.

   See also setMinimum(), setMaximum(), and setSingleStep().

  void QSpinBox::setRange ( int min, int max )

   Convenience function to set the minimum, min, and maximum, max, values
   with a single function call.
    setRange(min, max);

   is equivalent to:
    setMinimum(min);
    setMaximum(max);

   See also minimum and maximum.

  QString QSpinBox::textFromValue ( int v ) const   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is used by the spin box whenever it needs to
   display value v. The default implementation returns a string
   containing v printed in the standard way using QLocale().toString(v).
   Reimplementations may return anything. (See the example in the
   detailed description.)

   Note that Qt does not call this function for specialValueText() and
   that neither prefix() nor suffix() should be included in the return
   value.

   If you reimplement this, you may also need to reimplement
   valueFromText() and validate()

   See also valueFromText() and validate().

  void QSpinBox::valueChanged ( int i )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted whenever the spin box's value is changed. The
   new value's integer value is passed in i.

  void QSpinBox::valueChanged ( const QString & text )   [signal]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   The new value is passed literally in text with no prefix() or
   suffix().

  int QSpinBox::valueFromText ( const QString & text ) const   [virtual
  protected]

   This virtual function is used by the spin box whenever it needs to
   interpret text entered by the user as a value. Note that neither
   prefix() nor suffix() are included when this function is called by Qt.

   Subclasses that need to display spin box values in a non-numeric way
   need to reimplement this function.

   Note that Qt handles specialValueText() separately; this function is
   only concerned with the other values.

   The default implementation tries to interpret text as an integer using
   QString::toInt() and returns the value.

   See also textFromValue() and validate().
