Detailed Description

   The QPainter class performs low-level painting on widgets and other
   paint devices.

   The painter provides highly optimized functions to do most of the
   drawing GUI programs require. QPainter can draw everything from simple
   lines to complex shapes like pies and chords. It can also draw aligned
   text and pixmaps. Normally, it draws in a "natural" coordinate system,
   but it can also do view and world transformation.

   The typical use of a painter is:
     * Construct a painter.
     * Set a pen, a brush etc.
     * Draw.
     * Destroy the painter.

   The common use of QPainter is inside a widget's paint event. Here's
   one simple example:
    void SimpleExampleWidget::paintEvent()
    {
        QPainter paint(this);
        paint.setPen(Qt::blue);
        paint.drawText(rect(), Qt::AlignCenter, "The Text");
    }

   If you need to draw a complex shape, especially if you need to do so
   repeatedly, consider creating a QPainterPath and drawing it using
   drawPath().

   Usage is simple, and there are many settings you can use:
     * font() is the currently set font.
     * brush() is the currently set brush; the color or pattern that's
       used for filling e.g. circles.
     * pen() is the currently set pen; the color or stipple that's used
       for drawing lines or boundaries.
     * backgroundMode() is Opaque or Transparent, i.e. whether
       background() is used or not.
     * backgroundColor() only applies when backgroundMode() is Opaque and
       pen() is a stipple. In that case, it describes the color of the
       background pixels in the stipple.
     * brushOrigin() is the origin of the tiled brushes, normally the
       origin of widget's background.
     * viewport(), window(), matrix() and many more make up the painter's
       coordinate transformation system. See The Coordinate System for an
       explanation of this, or see below for a very brief overview of the
       functions.
     * hasClipping() is whether the painter clips at all. (The paint
       device clips, too.) If the painter clips, it clips to
       clipRegion().

   Note that some of these settings mirror settings in some paint
   devices, e.g. QWidget::font(). QPainter::begin() (or the QPainter
   constructor) copies these attributes from the paint device. Calling,
   for example, QWidget::setFont() doesn't take effect until the next
   time a painter begins painting on it.

   save() saves all of these settings on an internal stack, restore()
   pops them back.

   The core functionality of QPainter is drawing, and there are functions
   to draw most primitives: drawPoint(), drawPoints(), drawLine(),
   drawRect(), drawRoundRect(), drawEllipse(), drawArc(), drawPie(),
   drawChord(), drawLineSegments(), drawPolyline(), drawPolygon(),
   drawConvexPolygon() and drawCubicBezier(). All of these functions have
   integer and floating point versions.

   There are functions to draw pixmaps/images, namely drawPixmap(),
   drawImage() and drawTiledPixmap(). Both drawPixmap() and drawImage()
   produce the same result, except that drawPixmap() is faster on-screen
   while drawImage() may be faster on a QPrinter or other devices.

   Text drawing is done using drawText(). When you need fine-grained
   positioning, boundingRect() tells you where a given drawText() command
   would draw.

   There is a drawPicture() function that draws the contents of an entire
   QPicture using this painter. drawPicture() is the only function that
   disregards all the painter's settings as QPicture has its own
   settings.

   Normally, the QPainter operates on the device's own coordinate system
   (usually pixels), but QPainter has good support for coordinate
   transformations. See The Coordinate System for a more general overview
   and a simple example.

   The most common functions used are scale(), rotate(), translate() and
   shear(), all of which operate on the matrix(). setMatrix() can replace
   or add to the currently set matrix().

   setViewport() sets the rectangle on which QPainter operates. The
   default is the entire device, which is usually fine. setWindow() sets
   the coordinate system, that is, the rectangle that maps to viewport().
   What's drawn inside the window() ends up being inside the viewport().
   The window's default is the same as the viewport.

   QPainter can clip any drawing operation to a rectangle, a region, or a
   vector path. The current clip is available using the functions
   clipRegion() and clipPath(). Wether paths or regions are preferred
   (faster) depends on the underlying paintEngine(). For example, the
   QImage paint engine prefers paths while the X11 paint engine prefers
   regions. Setting a clip is done in the painters logical coordinates.

   After QPainter's clipping, the paint device may also clip. For
   example, most widgets clip away the pixels used by child widgets, and
   most printers clip away an area near the edges of the paper. This
   additional clipping is not reflected by the return value of
   clipRegion() or hasClipping().

   isActive() indicates whether the painter is active. begin() (and the
   most usual constructor) makes it active. end() (and the destructor)
   deactivates it. If the painter is active, device() returns the paint
   device on which the painter paints.

   Sometimes it is desirable to make someone else paint on an unusual
   QPaintDevice. QPainter supports a static function to do this,
   setRedirected().

   setTabStops() and setTabArray() can change where the tab stops are,
   but these are very seldomly used.

   Warning: Unless a widget has the Qt::WA_PaintOutsidePaintEvent
   attribute set. A QPainter can only be used on a widget inside a
   paintEvent() or a function called by a paintEvent(). On Mac OS X, you
   can only paint on a widget in a paintEvent() regardless of this
   attribute's setting.

   See also QPaintDevice, QWidget, QPixmap, QPrinter, QPicture,
   QPaintEngine, and The Coordinate System.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QPainter::CompositionMode

   Defines one of the Porter-Duff composition operations. Composition
   modes are used to specify how a source and destination pixel are
   merged together.

   The most common type is SourceOver (often referred to as just alpha
   blending) where the source pixel is blended on top of the destination
   pixel in such a way that the alpha component of the source defines the
   translucensy of the pixel.

   Porter Duff operator will only work when the paint device is a QImage
   in Format::ARGB32_Premultiplied or Format::ARGB32, where the
   premultiplied version is the preferred format.

   When a composition mode is set it applies to all painting operator,
   pens, brushes, gradients and pixmap/image drawing.

   Constant Value Description
   QPainter::CompositionMode_SourceOver 0 This is the default mode. The
   alpha of the source is used to blend the pixel on top of the
   destination.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_DestinationOver 1 The alpha of the
   destination is used to blend it on top of the source pixels. This mode
   is the inverse of CompositionMode_SourceOver.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_Clear 2 The pixels in the destination are
   cleared (set to fully transparent) independent of the source.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_Source 3 The output is the source pixel.
   (This means a basic copy operation and is identical to SourceOver when
   the source pixel is opaque).
   QPainter::CompositionMode_Destination 4 The output is the destination
   pixel. This means that the blending has no effect. This mode is the
   inverse of CompositionMode_Source.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_SourceIn 5 The output is the source, where
   the alpha is reduced by that of the destination.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_DestinationIn 6 The output is the
   destination, where the alpha is reduced by that of the source. This
   mode is the inverse of CompositionMode_SourceIn.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_SourceOut 7 The output is the source, where
   the alpha is reduced by the inverse of destination.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_DestinationOut 8 The output is the
   destionation, where the alpha is reduced byt eh inverse of the source.
   This mode is the inverse of Compositionmode_SourceOut.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_SourceAtop 9 The source pixel is blended on
   top of the destination, with the alpha of the source pixel reduced by
   the alpha of the destination pixel.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_DestinationAtop 10 The destination pixel is
   blended on top of the source, with the alpha of the destination pixel
   is reduced by the alpha of the destination pixel. This mode is the
   inverse of CompositionMode_SourceAtop.
   QPainter::CompositionMode_Xor 11 The source which alpha reduced with
   the inverse of the destination is merged with the destination which
   alpha is reduced by the inverse of the source.

  enum QPainter::RenderHint
  flags QPainter::RenderHints

   Renderhints are used to specify flags to QPainter that may or may not
   be respected by any given engine.

   Constant Value Description
   QPainter::Antialiasing 0x01 Indicates that the engine should antialias
   edges of primitives if possible.
   QPainter::TextAntialiasing 0x02 Indicates that the engine should
   antialias text if possible.
   QPainter::SmoothPixmapTransform 0x04 Indicates that the engine should
   use a smooth pixmap transformation algorithm (such as bilinear) rather
   than nearest neighbor.

   The RenderHints type is a typedef for QFlags<RenderHint>. It stores an
   OR combination of RenderHint values.

Member Function Documentation

  QPainter::QPainter ()

   Constructs a painter.

   Notice that all painter settings (setPen, setBrush etc.) are reset to
   default values when begin() is called.

   See also begin() and end().

  QPainter::QPainter ( QPaintDevice * pd )

   Constructs a painter that begins painting the paint device pd
   immediately.

   This constructor is convenient for short-lived painters, e.g. in a
   paint event and should be used only once. The constructor calls
   begin() for you and the QPainter destructor automatically calls end().

   Here's an example using begin() and end():
    void MyWidget::paintEvent(QPaintEvent *)
    {
        QPainter p;
        p.begin(this);
        p.drawLine(...);        // drawing code
        p.end();
    }

   The same example using this constructor:
    void MyWidget::paintEvent(QPaintEvent *)
    {
        QPainter p(this);
        p.drawLine(...);        // drawing code
    }

   Since the constructor cannot provide feedback when the initialization
   of the painter failed you should rather use begin() and end() to paint
   on external devices, e.g. printers.

   See also begin() and end().

  QPainter::~QPainter ()

   Destroys the painter.

  const QBrush & QPainter::background () const

   Returns the current background brush.

   See also setBackground() and QBrush.

  Qt::BGMode QPainter::backgroundMode () const

   Returns the current background mode.

   See also setBackgroundMode() and Qt::BGMode.

  bool QPainter::begin ( QPaintDevice * pd )

   Begins painting the paint device pd and returns true if successful;
   otherwise returns false.

   The errors that can occur are serious problems, such as these:
    p->begin(0); // impossible - paint device cannot be 0

    QPixmap pm(0, 0);
    p->begin(&pm); // impossible - pm.isNull();

    p->begin(myWidget);
    p2->begin(myWidget); // impossible - only one painter at a time

   Note that most of the time, you can use one of the constructors
   instead of begin(), and that end() is automatically done at
   destruction.

   Warning: A paint device can only be painted by one painter at a time.

   See also end().

  QRectF QPainter::boundingRect ( const QRectF & rect, int flags, const QString
  & str )

   Returns the bounding rectangle of the aligned text that would be

   whichever is the larger.

   The flags argument is the bitwise OR of the following flags:

                                Flag Meaning
    Qt::AlignLeft aligns to the left border, or to the right border for
                          right-to-left languages.
    Qt::AlignRight aligns to the right border, or to the left border for
                          right-to-left languages.
               Qt::AlignHCenter aligns horizontally centered.
                   Qt::AlignTop aligns to the top border.
                Qt::AlignBottom aligns to the bottom border.
                Qt::AlignVCenter aligns vertically centered.
         Qt::AlignCenter (== Qt::AlignHCenter | Qt::AlignVCenter).
         Qt::TextSingleLine ignores newline characters in the text.
                      Qt::TextExpandTabs expands tabs.
                 Qt::TextShowMnemonic interprets "&x" as x.
          Qt::TextWordBreak breaks the text to fit the rectangle.

   Qt::Horizontal alignment defaults to Qt::AlignLeft and vertical
   alignment defaults to Qt::AlignTop.

   If several of the horizontal or several of the vertical alignment
   flags are set, the resulting alignment is undefined.

  void QPainter::drawTiledPixmap ( int x, int y, int w, int h, const QPixmap &
  pixmap, int sx = 0, int sy = 0 )

   Draws a tiled pixmap in the specified rectangle.

   (x, y) specifies the top-left point in the paint device that is to be
   drawn onto; with the width and height given by w and h. (sx, sy)
   specifies the top-left point in the pixmap that is to be drawn; this
   defaults to (0, 0).

   Calling drawTiledPixmap() is similar to calling drawPixmap() several
   times to fill (tile) an area with a pixmap, but is potentially much
   more efficient depending on the underlying window system.

  void QPainter::setBackground ( const QBrush & bg )

   Sets the background brush of the painter to bg.

   The background brush is the brush that is filled in when drawing
   opaque text, stippled lines and bitmaps. The background brush has no
   effect in transparent background mode (which is the default).

   See also background(), setBackgroundMode(), and Qt::BGMode.

  void QPainter::setBackgroundMode ( Qt::BGMode mode )

   Sets the background mode of the painter to mode, which must be either
   Qt::TransparentMode (the default) or Qt::OpaqueMode.

   Transparent mode draws stippled lines and text without setting the
   background pixels. Opaque mode fills these space with the current
   background color.

   Note that in order to draw a bitmap or pixmap transparently, you must
   use QPixmap::setMask().

   See also backgroundMode() and setBackground().

  void QPainter::setBrush ( Qt::BrushStyle style )

   Sets the painter's brush to black color and the specified style.

   See also brush() and QBrush.

  void QPainter::setBrush ( const QBrush & brush )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the painter's brush to brush.

   The brush defines how shapes are filled.

   See also brush().

  void QPainter::setBrushOrigin ( const QPointF & p )

   Sets the brush origin to p.

   The brush origin specifies the (0, 0) coordinate of the painter's
   brush. This setting only applies to pattern brushes and pixmap
   brushes.

   See also brushOrigin().

  void QPainter::setBrushOrigin ( const QPoint & p )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the brush's origin to p.

  void QPainter::setBrushOrigin ( int x, int y )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the brush's origin to point (x, y).

  void QPainter::setClipPath ( const QPainterPath & path, Qt::ClipOperation op
  = Qt::ReplaceClip )

   Sets the clip path for the painter to path, with the clip operation
   op.

   The clip path is specified in logical (painter) coordinates.

  void QPainter::setClipRect ( const QRect & rect, Qt::ClipOperation op =
  Qt::ReplaceClip )

   Sets the clip region to the rectangle rect using the clip operation
   op. The default operation is to replace the current clip rectangle.

   See also setClipRegion(), clipRegion(), and setClipping().

  void QPainter::setClipRect ( int x, int y, int w, int h, Qt::ClipOperation op
  = Qt::ReplaceClip )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the clip region to the rectangle x, y, w, h and enables clipping.

   See also setClipRegion(), clipRegion(), and setClipping().

  void QPainter::setClipRect ( const QRectF & rect, Qt::ClipOperation op =
  Qt::ReplaceClip )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the clip region of the rectange rect.

  void QPainter::setClipRegion ( const QRegion & r, Qt::ClipOperation op =
  Qt::ReplaceClip )

   Sets the clip region to r using the clip operation op. The default
   clip operation is to replace the current clip region.

   Note that the clip region is given in logical coordinates and subject
   to coordinate transformation.

   See also setClipRect(), clipRegion(), and setClipping().

  void QPainter::setClipping ( bool enable )

   Enables clipping if enable is true, or disables clipping if enable is
   false.

   See also hasClipping(), setClipRect(), and setClipRegion().

  void QPainter::setCompositionMode ( CompositionMode mode )

   Sets the composition mode to mode.

   Warning: Not all paintdevices support non default composition modes.

   See also QPainter::CompositionMode and
   QPaintEngine::PaintEngineFeature.

  void QPainter::setFont ( const QFont & font )

   Sets the painter's font to font.

   This font is used by subsequent drawText() functions. The text color
   is the same as the pen color.

   If you set a font that isn't available, Qt finds a close match. font()
   will return what you set using setFont() and fontInfo() returns the
   font actually being used (which may be the same).

   See also font() and drawText().

  void QPainter::setLayoutDirection ( Qt::LayoutDirection direction )

   Sets the layout direction used by the painter when drawing text to the
   direction specified.

   See also layoutDirection().

  void QPainter::setMatrix ( const QMatrix & matrix, bool combine = false )

   Sets the transformation matrix to matrix and enables transformations.

   If combine is true, then matrix is combined with the current
   transformation matrix; otherwise matrix replaces the current
   transformation matrix.

   If matrix is the identity matrix and combine is false, this function
   calls setMatrixEnabled(false). (The identity matrix is the matrix
   where QMatrix::m11() and QMatrix::m22() are 1.0 and the rest are 0.0.)

   World transformations are applied after the view transformations (i.e.
   window and viewport).

   The following functions can transform the coordinate system without
   using a QMatrix:
     * translate()
     * scale()
     * shear()
     * rotate()

   They operate on the painter's worldMatrix() and are implemented like
   this:
    void QPainter::rotate(qreal a)
    {
        QMatrix m;
        m.rotate(a);
        setMatrix(m, true);
    }

   Note that you should always have combine be true when you are drawing
   into a QPicture. Otherwise it may not be possible to replay the
   picture with additional transformations. Using translate(), scale(),
   etc., is safe.

   For a brief overview of coordinate transformation, see the Coordinate
   System Overview.

   See also matrix(), setMatrixEnabled(), and QMatrix.

  void QPainter::setMatrixEnabled ( bool enable )

   Enables transformations if enable is true, or disables world
   transformations if enable is false. The world transformation matrix is
   not changed.

   See also setMatrix() and matrix().

  void QPainter::setPen ( const QPen & pen )

   Sets a new painter pen.

   The pen defines how to draw lines and outlines, and it also defines
   the text color.

   See also pen().

  void QPainter::setPen ( const QColor & color )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the painter's pen to have style Qt::SolidLine, width 0 and the

   See also pen() and QPen.

  void QPainter::setRenderHint ( RenderHint hint, bool on = true )

   Sets the render hint hint on this painter if on is true; otherwise
   clears the render hint.

  void QPainter::setViewTransformEnabled ( bool enable )

   Enables view transformations if enable is true, or disables view
   transformations if enable is false.

   See also viewTransformEnabled(), setWindow(), setViewport(),
   setMatrix(), and setMatrixEnabled().

  void QPainter::setViewport ( int x, int y, int w, int h )

   Sets the viewport rectangle view transformation for the painter and
   enables view transformation.

   The viewport rectangle is part of the view transformation. The
   viewport specifies the device coordinate system and is specified by
   the x, y, w width and h height parameters. Its sister, the window(),
   specifies the logical coordinate system.

   The default viewport rectangle is the same as the device's rectangle.
   See the Coordinate System Overview for an overview of coordinate
   transformation.

   See also viewport(), setWindow(), setViewTransformEnabled(),
   setMatrix(), and setMatrixEnabled().

  void QPainter::setViewport ( const QRect & r )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the painter's viewport rectangle to r.

  void QPainter::setWindow ( int x, int y, int w, int h )

   Sets the window rectangle view transformation for the painter and
   enables view transformation.

   The window rectangle is part of the view transformation. The window
   specifies the logical coordinate system and is specified by the x, y,
   w width and h height parameters. Its sister, the viewport(), specifies
   the device coordinate system.

   The default window rectangle is the same as the device's rectangle.
   See the Coordinate System Overview for an overview of coordinate
   transformation.

   See also window(), setViewport(), setViewTransformEnabled(),
   setMatrix(), and setMatrixEnabled().

  void QPainter::setWindow ( const QRect & r )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Sets the painter's window to the rectangle r.

  void QPainter::shear ( qreal sh, qreal sv )

   Shears the coordinate system by (sh, sv).

   and xForm().

  void QPainter::strokePath ( const QPainterPath & path, const QPen & pen )

   Draws the outline (strokes) the path path with the pen specified by
   pen

  void QPainter::translate ( const QPointF & offset )

   Translates the coordinate system by offset. After this call, offset is
   added to points.

   For example, the following code draws the same point twice:
    void MyWidget::paintEvent()
    {
        QPainter paint(this);

        paint.drawPoint(0, 0);

        paint.translate(100.0, 40.0);
        paint.drawPoint(-100, -40);
    }
