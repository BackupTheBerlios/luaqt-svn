Detailed Description

   The QIcon class provides scalable icons in different modes and states.

   A QIcon can generate smaller, larger, active, and disabled pixmaps
   from the set of pixmaps it is given. Such pixmaps are used by Qt
   widgets to show an icon representing a particular action.

   The simplest use of QIcon is to create one from a QPixmap file or
   resource, and then use it, allowing Qt to work out all the required
   icon styles and sizes. For example:
    QToolButton *button = new QToolButton;
    button->setIcon(QIcon("open.xpm"));

   When you retrieve a pixmap using pixmap(QSize, Mode, State), and no
   pixmap for this given size, mode and state has been added with
   addFile() or addPixmap(), then QIcon will generate one on the fly.
   This pixmap generation happens in a QIconEngine. The default engine
   scales pixmaps down if required, but never up, and it uses the current
   style to calculate a disabled appearance. By using custom icon
   engines, you can customize every aspect of generated icons. With
   QIconEnginePlugin it is possible to register different icon engines
   for different file suffixes, so you could provide a SVG icon engine or
   any other scalable format.

  Making Classes that Use QIcon

   If you write your own widgets that have an option to set a small
   pixmap, consider allowing a QIcon to be set for that pixmap. The Qt
   class QToolButton is an example of such a widget.

   Provide a method to set a QIcon, and when you draw the icon, choose
   whichever pixmap is appropriate for the current state of your widget.
   For example:
    void MyWidget::drawIcon(QPainter *painter, QPoint pos)
    {
        QPixmap pixmap = icon.pixmap(QSize(22, 22),
                                       isEnabled() ? QIcon::Normal
                                                   : QIcon::Disabled,
                                       isOn() ? QIcon::On
                                              : QIcon::Off);
        painter->drawPixmap(pos, pixmap);
    }

   You might also make use of the Active mode, perhaps making your widget
   Active when the mouse is over the widget (see QWidget::enterEvent()),
   while the mouse is pressed pending the release that will activate the
   function, or when it is the currently selected item. If the widget can
   be toggled, the "On" mode might be used to draw a different icon.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QIcon::Mode

   This enum type describes the mode for which a pixmap is intended to be
   used. The currently defined modes are:

   Constant Value Description
   QIcon::Normal 0 Display the pixmap when the user is not interacting
   with the icon, but the functionality represented by the icon is
   available.
   QIcon::Disabled 1 Display the pixmap when the functionality
   represented by the icon is not available.
   QIcon::Active 2 Display the pixmap when the functionality represented
   by the icon is available and the user is interacting with the icon,
   for example, moving the mouse over it or clicking it.

  enum QIcon::State

   This enum describes the state for which a pixmap is intended to be
   used. The state can be:

    Constant  Value                       Description
   QIcon::Off   1   Display the pixmap when the widget is in an "off" state
   QIcon::On    0   Display the pixmap when the widget is in an "on" state

Member Function Documentation

  QIcon::QIcon ()

   Constructs a null icon.

  QIcon::QIcon ( const QPixmap & pixmap )

   Constructs an icon from a pixmap.

  QIcon::QIcon ( const QIcon & other )

   Constructs a copy of other. This is very fast.

  QIcon::QIcon ( const QString & fileName )

   Constructs an icon from the file with the given fileName. The file
   will be loaded on demand. If the file does not exist or is of an
   unknown format, the icon becomes a null icon.

   If fileName contains a relative path (e.g. the filename only) the
   relevant file must be found relative to the runtime working directory.

   The file name can be either refer to an actual file on disk or to one
   of the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System
   overview for details on how to embed images and other resource files
   in the application's executable.

  QIcon::QIcon ( QIconEngine * engine )

   Creates an icon with a specific icon engine. The icon takes ownership
   of the engine.

  QIcon::~QIcon ()

   Destroys the icon.

  QSize QIcon::actualSize ( const QSize & size, Mode mode = Normal, State state
  = Off ) const

   Returns the actual size of the icon for the requested size, mode, and
   state. The result might be smaller than requested, but never larger.

   See also pixmap() and paint().

  void QIcon::addFile ( const QString & fileName, const QSize & size = QSize(),
  Mode mode = Normal, State state = Off )

   Adds a pixmap from the file with the given fileName to the icon, as a
   specialization for size, mode and state. The file will be loaded on
   demand. Note: custom icon engines are free to ignore additionally
   added pixmaps.

   If fileName contains a relative path (e.g. the filename only) the
   relevant file must be found relative to the runtime working directory.

   The file name can be either refer to an actual file on disk or to one
   of the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System
   overview for details on how to embed images and other resource files
   in the application's executable.

   See also addPixmap().

  void QIcon::addPixmap ( const QPixmap & pixmap, Mode mode = Normal, State
  state = Off )

   Adds pixmap to the icon, as a specialization for mode and state.

   Custom icon engines are free to ignore additionally added pixmaps.

   See also addFile().

  bool QIcon::isNull () const

   Returns true if the icon is empty; otherwise returns false.

  void QIcon::paint ( QPainter * painter, const QRect & rect, Qt::Alignment
  alignment = Qt::AlignCenter, Mode mode = Normal, State state = Off ) const

   Uses the painter to paint the icon with specified alignment, required
   mode, and state into the rectangle rect.

   See also actualSize() and pixmap().

  void QIcon::paint ( QPainter * painter, int x, int y, int w, int h,
  Qt::Alignment alignment = Qt::AlignCenter, Mode mode = Normal, State state =
  Off ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Paints the icon into the rectangle QRect(x, y, w, h).

  QPixmap QIcon::pixmap ( const QSize & size, Mode mode = Normal, State state =
  Off ) const

   Returns a pixmap with the requested size, mode, and state, generating
   one if necessary. The pixmap might be smaller than requested, but
   never larger.

   See also actualSize() and paint().

  QPixmap QIcon::pixmap ( int w, int h, Mode mode = Normal, State state = Off )
  const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a pixmap of size QSize(w, h).

  QPixmap QIcon::pixmap ( int extent, Mode mode = Normal, State state = Off )
  const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a pixmap of size QSize(extent, extent).

  int QIcon::serialNumber () const

   Returns a number that uniquely identifies the contents of this QIcon
   object. This means that multiple QIcon objects can have the same
   serial number as long as they refer to the same contents.

   A null icon always has a serial number of 0.

   See also QPixmap::serialNumber().

  QIcon::operator QVariant () const

   Returns the icon as a QVariant.

  QIcon & QIcon::operator= ( const QIcon & other )

   Assigns the other icon to this icon and returns a reference to this
   icon.
