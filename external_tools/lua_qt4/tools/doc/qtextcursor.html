Detailed Description

   The QTextCursor class offers an API to access and modify
   QTextDocuments.

   Text cursors are objects that are used to access and modify the
   contents and underlying structure of text documents via a programming
   interface that mimics the behavior of a cursor in a text editor.
   QTextCursor contains information about both the cursor's position
   within a QTextDocument and any selection that it has made.

   QTextCursor is modeled on the way a text cursor behaves in a text
   editor, providing a programmatic means of performing standard actions
   through the user interface. A document can be thought of as a single
   string of characters with the cursor's position() being between any
   two characters (or at the very beginning or very end of the document).
   Documents can also contain tables, lists, images, and other objects in
   addition to text but, from the developer's point of view, the document
   can be treated as one long string. Some portions of that string can be
   considered to lie within particular blocks (e.g. paragraphs), or
   within a table's cell, or a list's item, or other structural elements.
   When we refer to "current character" we mean the character immediately
   after the cursor position() in the document; similarly the "current
   block" is the block that contains the cursor position().

   A QTextCursor also has an anchor() position. The text that is between
   the anchor() and the position() is the selection. If anchor() ==
   position() there is no selection.

   The cursor position can be changed programmatically using
   setPosition() and movePosition(); the latter can also be used to
   select text. For selections see selectionStart(), selectionEnd(),
   hasSelection(), clearSelection(), and removeSelectedText().

   If the position() is at the start of a block atBlockStart() returns
   true; and if it is at the end of a block atBlockEnd() returns true.
   The format of the current character is returned by charFormat(), and
   the format of the current block is returned by blockFormat().

   Formatting can be applied to the current character (the character
   immedately after position()) using applyCharFormatModifier(), and to
   the current block (the block that contains position()) using
   setBlockFormat() and applyBlockFormatModifier(). The text at the
   current character position can be turned into a list using
   createList().

   Deletions can be achieved using deleteChar(), deletePreviousChar(),
   and removeSelectedText().

   Text strings can be inserted into the document with the insertText()
   function, blocks (representing new paragraphs) can be inserted with
   insertBlock().

   Existing fragments of text can be inserted with insertFragment() but,
   if you want to insert pieces of text in various formats, it is usually
   still easier to use insertText() and supply a character format.

   Various types of higher-level structure can also be inserted into the
   document with the cursor:
     * Lists are ordered sequences of block elements that are decorated
       with bullet points or symbols. These are inserted in a specified
       format with insertList().
     * Tables are inserted with the insertTable() function, and can be
       given an optional format. These contain an array of cells that can
       be traversed using the cursor.
     * Inline images are inserted with insertImage(). The image to be
       used can be specified in an image format, or by name.
     * Frames are inserted by calling insertFrame() with a specified
       format.

   Actions can be grouped (i.e. treated as a single action for undo/redo)
   using beginEditBlock() and endEditBlock().

   Cursor movements are limited to valid cursor positions. In Latin
   writing this is usually after every character in the text. In some
   other writing systems cursor movements are limited to "clusters" (e.g.
   a syllable in Devanagari, or a base letter plus diacritics). Functions
   such as movePosition() and deleteChar() limit cursor movement to these
   valid positions.

  int QTextCursor::anchor () const

   Returns the anchor position; this is the same as position() unless
   there is a selection in which case position() marks one end of the
   selection and anchor() marks the other end. Just like the cursor
   position, the anchor position is between characters.

   See also position(), setPosition(), movePosition(), selectionStart(),
   and selectionEnd().

  bool QTextCursor::atBlockEnd () const

   Returns true if the cursor is at the end of a block; otherwise returns
   false.

   See also atBlockStart() and atEnd().

  bool QTextCursor::atBlockStart () const

   Returns true if the cursor is at the start of a block; otherwise
   returns false.

   See also atBlockEnd() and atStart().

  bool QTextCursor::atEnd () const

   Returns true if the cursor is at the end of the document; otherwise
   returns false.

   Returns a pointer to the current frame. Returns 0 if the cursor is
   invalid.

   See also insertFrame().

  QTextList * QTextCursor::currentList () const

   Returns the current list if the cursor position() is inside a block
   that is part of a list; otherwise returns 0.

   See also insertList() and createList().

   that should appear as a single operation from an undo/redo point of
   view.

   See also beginEditBlock().

  bool QTextCursor::hasComplexSelection () const

   Returns true if the cursor contains a selection that is not simply a
   range from selectionStart() to selectionEnd(); otherwise returns
   false.

   Complex selections are ones that span at least two cells in a table;
   their extent is specified by selectedTableCells().

  bool QTextCursor::hasSelection () const

   Returns true if the cursor contains a selection; otherwise returns
   false.

  void QTextCursor::insertBlock ()

   Inserts a new empty block at the cursor position() with the current
   blockFormat() and charFormat().

  void QTextCursor::insertImage ( const QTextImageFormat & format )

   Inserts the image defined by format at the current position().

  void QTextCursor::insertImage ( const QString & name )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Convenience method for inserting the image with the given name at the
   current position().

  QTextList * QTextCursor::insertList ( const QTextListFormat & format )

   Inserts a new block at the current position and makes it the first
   list item of a newly created list with the given format. Returns the
   created list.

   See also currentList(), createList(), and insertBlock().

  QTextList * QTextCursor::insertList ( QTextListFormat::Style style )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Inserts a new block at the current position and makes it the first
   list item of a newly created list with the given style. Returns the
   created list.

   See also currentList(), createList(), and insertBlock().

  QTextTable * QTextCursor::insertTable ( int rows, int columns, const
  QTextTableFormat & format )

   Creates a new table with the given number of rows and columns in the
   specified format, inserts it at the current cursor position() in the
   document, and returns the table object. The cursor is moved to the
   beginning of the first cell.

   There must be at least one row and one column in the table.

   See also currentTable().

  QTextTable * QTextCursor::insertTable ( int rows, int columns )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Creates a new table with the given number of rows and columns, inserts
   it at the current cursor position() in the document, and returns the
   table object. The cursor is moved to the beginning of the first cell.

   There must be at least one row and one column in the table.

   See also currentTable().

  void QTextCursor::insertText ( const QString & text )

   Inserts text at the current position, using the current character
   format.

   If there is a selection, the selection is deleted and replaced by
   text, for example:
    cursor.clearSelection();
    cursor.movePosition(QTextCursor::NextWord, QTextCursor::KeepAnchor);
    cursor.insertText("Hello World");

   This clears any existing selection, selects the word at the cursor
   (i.e. from position() forward), and replaces the selection with the
   phrase "Hello World".

   See also charFormat() and hasSelection().

  void QTextCursor::insertText ( const QString & text, const QTextCharFormat &
  format )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Inserts text at the current position with the given format.

  bool QTextCursor::isCopyOf ( const QTextCursor & other ) const

   Returns true if this cursor and other are copies of each other, i.e.
   one of them was created as a copy of the other and neither has moved
   since. This is much stricter than equality.

   See also operator=() and operator==().

  bool QTextCursor::isNull () const

   Returns true if the cursor is null; otherwise returns false. A null
   cursor is created by the default constructor.

  void QTextCursor::joinPreviousEditBlock ()

   Like beginEditBlock() indicates the start of a block of editing
   operations that should appear as a single operation for undo/redo.
   However unlike beginEditBlock() it does not start a new block but
   reverses the previous call to endEditBlock() and therefore makes
   following operations part of the previous edit block created.

   For example:
    QTextCursor cursor(textDocument);
    cursor.beginEditBlock();
    cursor.insertText("Hello");
    cursor.insertText("World");
    cursor.endEditBlock();

    ...

    cursor.joinPreviousEditBlock();
    cursor.insertText("Hey");
    cursor.endEditBlock();

    textDocument->undo();

   The call to undo() will cause all three insertions to be undone.

   See also beginEditBlock() and endEditBlock().

  void QTextCursor::mergeBlockCharFormat ( const QTextCharFormat & modifier )

   Modifies the block char format of the current block (or all blocks
   that are contained in the selection) with the block format specified
   by modifier.

   See also setBlockCharFormat().

  void QTextCursor::mergeBlockFormat ( const QTextBlockFormat & modifier )

   Modifies the block format of the current block (or all blocks that are
   contained in the selection) with the block format specified by
   modifier.

   See also setBlockFormat().

  void QTextCursor::mergeCharFormat ( const QTextCharFormat & modifier )

   Applies all the properties set in modifier to all the character
   formats that are part of the selection. Does nothing if the cursor
   does not have a selection.

   See also hasSelection().

  bool QTextCursor::movePosition ( MoveOperation op, MoveMode mode =
  MoveAnchor, int n = 1 )

   Moves the cursor in accordance with the MoveOperation op, using
   MoveMode mode. The move is performed n (default 1) times.

   If mode is KeepAnchor, the cursor selects the text it moves over. This
   is the same effect that the user achieves when they hold down the
   Shift key and move the cursor with the cursor keys.

  int QTextCursor::position () const

   Returns the absolute position of the cursor within the document. The
   cursor is positioned between characters.

   See also setPosition(), movePosition(), and anchor().

  void QTextCursor::removeSelectedText ()

   If there is a selection, its content is deleted; otherwise does
   nothing.

   See also hasSelection().

  void QTextCursor::select ( SelectionType selection )

   Selects text in the document according to the given selection.

  void QTextCursor::selectedTableCells ( int * firstRow, int * numRows, int *
  firstColumn, int * numColumns ) const

   If the selection spans over table cells, firstRow is populated with
   the number of the first row in the selection, firstColumn with the
   number of the first column in the selection, and numRows and
   numColumns with the number of rows and columns in the selection. If
   the selection does not span any table cells the results are harmless
   but undefined.

  QString QTextCursor::selectedText () const

   Returns the current selection's text (which may be empty). This only
   returns the text, with no rich text formatting information. If you
   want a document fragment (i.e. formatted rich text) use selection()
   instead.

  QTextDocumentFragment QTextCursor::selection () const

   Returns the current selection (which may be empty) with all its
   formatting information. If you just want the selected text (i.e. plain
   text) use selectedText() instead.

  int QTextCursor::selectionEnd () const

   Returns the end of the selection or position() if the cursor doesn't
   have a selection.

   See also selectionStart(), position(), and anchor().

  int QTextCursor::selectionStart () const

   Returns the start of the selection or position() if the cursor doesn't
   have a selection.

   See also selectionEnd(), position(), and anchor().

  void QTextCursor::setBlockCharFormat ( const QTextCharFormat & format )

   Sets the block char format of the current block (or all blocks that
   are contained in the selection) to format.

   See also blockCharFormat().

  void QTextCursor::setBlockFormat ( const QTextBlockFormat & format )

   Sets the block format of the current block (or all blocks that are
   contained in the selection) to format.

   See also blockFormat().

  void QTextCursor::setCharFormat ( const QTextCharFormat & format )

   Set the character format to the given format for the current
   selection. Does nothing if the cursor does not have a selection.

   See also hasSelection().

  void QTextCursor::setPosition ( int pos, MoveMode m = MoveAnchor )

   Moves the cursor to the absolute position in the document specified by
   pos using a MoveMode specified by m. The cursor is positioned between
   characters.

   See also position(), movePosition(), and anchor().

  bool QTextCursor::operator!= ( const QTextCursor & other ) const

   Returns true if the other cursor is at a different position in the
   document as this cursor; otherwise returns false.

  bool QTextCursor::operator< ( const QTextCursor & other ) const

   Returns true if the other cursor is positioned later in the document
   than this cursor; otherwise returns false.

  bool QTextCursor::operator<= ( const QTextCursor & other ) const

   Returns true if the other cursor is positioned later or at the same
   position in the document as this cursor; otherwise returns false.

  QTextCursor & QTextCursor::operator= ( const QTextCursor & cursor )

   Makes a copy of cursor and assigns it to this QTextCursor.

  bool QTextCursor::operator== ( const QTextCursor & other ) const

   Returns true if the other cursor is at the same position in the
   document as this cursor; otherwise returns false.

  bool QTextCursor::operator> ( const QTextCursor & other ) const

   Returns true if the other cursor is positioned earlier in the document
   than this cursor; otherwise returns false.

  bool QTextCursor::operator>= ( const QTextCursor & other ) const

   Returns true if the other cursor is positioned earlier or at the same
   position in the document as this cursor; otherwise returns false.
