Detailed Description

   The QMultiHash class is a convenience QHash subclass that provides
   multi-valued hashes.

   QMultiHash<Key, T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It
   inherits QHash and extends it with a few convenience functions that
   make it more suitable than QHash for storing multi-valued hashes. A
   multi-valued hash is a hash that allows multiple values with the same
   key; QHash normally doesn't allow that, unless you call
   QHash::insertMulti().

   Because QMultiHash inherits QHash, all of QHash's functionality also
   applies to QMultiHash. For example, you can use isEmpty() to test
   whether the hash is empty, and you can traverse a QMultiHash using
   QHash's iterator classes (for example, QHashIterator). But in
   addition, it provides an insert() function that corresponds to
   QHash::insertMulti(), and a replace() function that corresponds to
   QHash::insert(). It also provides convenient operator+() and
   operator+=().

   Example:
    QMultiHash<QString, int> hash1, hash2, hash3;

    hash1.insert("plenty", 100);
    hash1.insert("plenty", 2000);
    // hash1.size() == 2

    hash2.insert("plenty", 5000);
    // hash2.size() == 1

    hash3 = hash1 + hash2;
    // hash3.size() == 3

   Unlike QHash, QMultiHash provides no operator[]. Use value() or
   replace() if you want to access the most recently inserted item with a
   certain key.

   If you want to retrieve all the values for a single key, you can use
   values(const Key &key), which returns a QList<T>:
    QList<int> values = hash.values("plenty");
    for (int i = 0; i < values.size(); ++i)
        cout << values.at(i) << endl;

   The items that share the same key are available from most recently to
   least recently inserted.

   A more efficient approach is to use QHashIterator::findNextKey() or
   QMutableHashIterator::findNextKey():
    QHashIterator<QString, int> i(hash);
    while (i.findNextKey("plenty"))
        cout << i.value() << endl;

   If you prefer the STL-style iterators, you can call find() to get the
   iterator for the first item with a key and iterate from there:
    QMultiHash<QString, int>::iterator i = hash.find("plenty");
    while (i != hash.end() && i.key() == "plenty") {
        cout << i.value() << endl;
        ++i;
    }

   QMultiHash's key and value data types must be assignable data types.
   You cannot, for example, store a QWidget as a value; instead, store a
   QWidget *. In addition, QMultiHash's key type must provide
   operator==(), and there must also be a global qHash() function that
   returns a hash value for an argument of the key's type. See the QHash
   documentation for details.

   See also QHash, QHashIterator, QMutableHashIterator, and QMultiMap.

Member Function Documentation

  QMultiHash::QMultiHash ()

   Constructs an empty hash.

  QMultiHash::QMultiHash ( const QHash<Key, T> & other )

   Constructs a copy of other (which can be a QHash or a QMultiHash).

   See also operator=().

  QHash<Key, T>::iterator QMultiHash::insert ( const Key & key, const T & value
  )

   Inserts a new item with the key key and a value of value.

   If there is already an item with the same key in the hash, this
   function will simply create a new one. (This behavior is different
   from replace(), which overwrites the value of an existing item.)

   See also replace().

  QHash<Key, T>::iterator QMultiHash::replace ( const Key & key, const T &
  value )

   Inserts a new item with the key key and a value of value.

   If there is already an item with the key key, that item's value is
   replaced with value.

   If there are multiple items with the key key, the most recently
   inserted item's value is replaced with value.

   See also insert().

  QMultiHash QMultiHash::operator+ ( const QMultiHash & other ) const

   Returns a hash that contains all the items in this hash in addition to
   all the items in other. If a key is common to both hashes, the
   resulting hash will contain the key multiple times.

   See also operator+=().

  QMultiHash & QMultiHash::operator+= ( const QMultiHash & other )

   Inserts all the items in the other hash into this hash and returns a
   reference to this hash.

   See also insert().
