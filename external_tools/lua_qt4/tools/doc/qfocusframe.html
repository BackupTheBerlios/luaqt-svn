Detailed Description

   The QFocusFrame widget provides a focus frame which can be outside of
   a widget's normal paintable area.

   Normally an application will not need to create its own QFocusFrame as
   QStyle will handle this detail for you. A style writer can optionally
   use a QFocusFrame to have a focus area outside of the widget's
   paintable geometry. In this way space need not be reserved for the
   widget to have focus but only set on a QWidget with
   QFocusFrame::setWidget. It is, however, legal to create your own
   QFocusFrame on a custom widget and set its geometry manually via
   QWidget::setGeometry however you will not get auto-placement when the
   focused widget changes size or placement.

Member Function Documentation

  QFocusFrame::QFocusFrame ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QFocusFrame.

   The focus frame will not monitor parent for updates but rather can be
   placed manually or by using QFocusFrame::setWidget. A QFocusFrame sets
   Qt::WA_NoChildEventsForParent attribute; as a result the parent will
   not receive a QEvent::ChildInserted event, this will make it possible
   to manually set the geometry of the QFocusFrame inside of a QSplitter
   or other child event monitoring widget.

   See also QFocusFrame::setWidget().

  QFocusFrame::~QFocusFrame ()

   Destructor.

  void QFocusFrame::setWidget ( QWidget * widget )

   QFocusFrame will track changes to widget and resize itself
   automatically. If the monitored widget's parent changes, QFocusFrame
   will follow the widget and place itself around the widget
   automatically. If the monitored widget is deleted, QFocusFrame will
   set it to zero.

   See also QFocusFrame::widget().

  QWidget * QFocusFrame::widget () const

   Returns the currently monitored widget for automatically resize and
   update.

   See also QFocusFrame::setWidget().
