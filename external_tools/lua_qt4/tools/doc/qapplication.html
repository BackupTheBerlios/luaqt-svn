Detailed Description

   The QApplication class manages the GUI application's control flow and
   main settings.

   It contains the main event loop, where all events from the window
   system and other sources are processed and dispatched. It also handles
   the application's initialization and finalization, and provides
   session management. It also handles most system-wide and
   application-wide settings.

   For any GUI application that uses Qt, there is precisely one
   QApplication object, no matter whether the application has 0, 1, 2 or
   more windows at any time. For non-GUI Qt applications, use
   QCoreApplication instead, which doesn't depend on the QtGui library.

   The QApplication object is accessible through the instance() function.
   (In earlier Qt versions the qApp global was used instead of
   instance().)

   QApplication's main areas of responsibility are:
     * It initializes the application with the user's desktop settings
       such as palette(), font() and doubleClickInterval(). It keeps
       track of these properties in case the user changes the desktop
       globally, for example through some kind of control panel.
     * It performs event handling, meaning that it receives events from
       the underlying window system and dispatches them to the relevant
       widgets. By using sendEvent() and postEvent() you can send your
       own events to widgets.
     * It parses common command line arguments and sets its internal
       state accordingly. See the constructor documentation below for
       more details about this.
     * It defines the application's look and feel, which is encapsulated
       in a QStyle object. This can be changed at runtime with
       setStyle().
     * It specifies how the application is to allocate colors. See
       setColorSpec() for details.
     * It provides localization of strings that are visible to the user
       via translate().
     * It provides some magical objects like the desktop() and the
       clipboard().
     * It knows about the application's windows. You can ask which widget
       is at a certain position using widgetAt(), get a list of
       topLevelWidgets() and closeAllWindows(), etc.
     * It manages the application's mouse cursor handling, see
       setOverrideCursor()
     * On the X window system, it provides functions to flush and sync
       the communication stream, see flushX() and syncX().
     * It provides support for sophisticated session management. This
       makes it possible for applications to terminate gracefully when
       the user logs out, to cancel a shutdown process if termination
       isn't possible and even to preserve the entire application's state
       for a future session. See isSessionRestored(), sessionId() and
       commitData() and saveState() for details.

   Since the QApplication object does so much initialization, it must be
   created before any other objects related to the user interface are
   created.

   Since it also deals with common command line arguments, it is usually
   a good idea to create it before any interpretation or modification of
   argv is done in the application itself.

Property Documentation

  cursorFlashTime : int

   This property holds the text cursor's flash (blink) time in
   milliseconds.

   The flash time is the time required to display, invert and restore the
   caret display. Usually the text cursor is displayed for half the
   cursor flash time, then hidden for the same amount of time, but this
   may vary.

   The default value on X11 is 1000 milliseconds. On Windows, the control
   panel value is used. Widgets should not cache this value since it may
   be changed at any time by the user changing the global desktop
   settings.

   Note that on Microsoft Windows, setting this property sets the cursor
   flash time for all applications.

   Access functions:
     * int cursorFlashTime ()
     * void setCursorFlashTime ( int )

  doubleClickInterval : int

   This property holds the time limit in milliseconds that distinguishes
   a double click from two consecutive mouse clicks.

   The default value on X11 is 400 milliseconds. On Windows and Mac OS X,
   the operating system's value is used.

   On Microsoft Windows, calling this function sets the double click
   interval for all applications.

   Access functions:
     * int doubleClickInterval ()
     * void setDoubleClickInterval ( int )

  globalStrut : QSize

   This property holds the minimum size that any GUI element that the
   user can interact with should have.

   For example no button should be resized to be smaller than the global
   strut size. The strut size should be considered when reimplementing
   GUI controls that may be used on touch-screens or similar I/O devices.

   Example:
    QSize MyWidget::sizeHint() const
    {
        return QSize(80, 25).expandedTo(QApplication::globalStrut());
    }

   Access functions:
     * QSize globalStrut ()
     * void setGlobalStrut ( const QSize & )

  keyboardInputInterval : int

   This property holds the time limit in milliseconds that distinguishes
   a key press from two consecutive key presses.

   The default value on X11 is 400 milliseconds. On Windows and Mac OS X,
   the operating system's value is used.

   Access functions:
     * int keyboardInputInterval ()
     * void setKeyboardInputInterval ( int )

  layoutDirection : Qt::LayoutDirection

   This property holds the default layout direction for this application.

   On system start-up, the default layout direction depends on the
   application's language.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::LayoutDirection layoutDirection ()
     * void setLayoutDirection ( Qt::LayoutDirection direction )

   See also QWidget::layoutDirection, isLeftToRight(), and
   isRightToLeft().

  quitOnLastWindowClosed : bool

   This property holds whether the application implicitly quits when the
   last window is closed.

   The default is true.

   Only top-level windows with the Qt::WA_QuitOnClose attribute set are
   taken into account. For convenience, this attribute is not set for
   transient top-level widgets such as splash screens, popup menus, and
   dialogs.

   Access functions:
     * bool quitOnLastWindowClosed ()
     * void setQuitOnLastWindowClosed ( bool quit )

   See also quit() and QWidget::close().

  startDragDistance : int

   If you support drag and drop in your application, and want to start a
   drag and drop operation after the user has moved the cursor a certain
   distance with a button held down, you should use this property's value
   as the minimum distance required.

   For example, if the mouse position of the click is stored in startPos
   and the current position (e.g. in the mouse move event) is currentPos,
   you can find out if a drag should be started with code like this:
    if ((startPos - currentPos).manhattanLength() >=
            QApplication::startDragDistance())
        startTheDrag();

   Qt uses this value internally, e.g. in QFileDialog.

   The default value is 4 pixels.

   Access functions:
     * int startDragDistance ()
     * void setStartDragDistance ( int l )

   See also startDragTime(), QPoint::manhattanLength(), and Drag and
   Drop.

  startDragTime : int

   This property holds the time in milliseconds that a mouse button must
   be held down before a drag and drop operation will begin.

   If you support drag and drop in your application, and want to start a
   drag and drop operation after the user has held down a mouse button
   for a certain amount of time, you should use this property's value as
   the delay.

   Qt also uses this delay internally, e.g. in QTextEdit and QLineEdit,
   for starting a drag.

   The default value is 500 ms.

   Access functions:
     * int startDragTime ()
     * void setStartDragTime ( int ms )

   See also startDragDistance() and Drag and Drop.

  wheelScrollLines : int

   This property holds the number of lines to scroll when the mouse wheel
   is rotated.

   If this number exceeds the number of visible lines in a certain
   widget, the widget should interpret the scroll operation as a single
   "page up" or "page down" operation instead.

   Access functions:
     * int wheelScrollLines ()
     * void setWheelScrollLines ( int )

  windowIcon : QIcon

   This property holds the default window icon.

   Access functions:
     * QIcon windowIcon ()
     * void setWindowIcon ( const QIcon & icon )

   See also QWidget::setWindowIcon() and Setting the Application Icon.

Member Function Documentation

  QApplication::QApplication ( int & argc, char ** argv )

   Initializes the window system and constructs an application object
   with argc command line arguments in argv.

   The global qApp pointer refers to this application object. Only one
   application object should be created.

   This application object must be constructed before any paint devices
   (including widgets, pixmaps, bitmaps etc.).

   Note that argc and argv might be changed. Qt removes command line
   arguments that it recognizes. The original argc and argv can be
   accessed later with qApp->argc() and qApp->argv(). The documentation
   for argv() contains a detailed description of how to process command
   line arguments.

   Qt debugging options (not available if Qt was compiled without the
   QT_DEBUG flag defined):
     * -nograb, tells Qt that it must never grab the mouse or the
       keyboard.
     * -dograb (only under X11), running under a debugger can cause an
       implicit -nograb, use -dograb to override.
     * -sync (only under X11), switches to synchronous mode for
       debugging.

   See Debugging Techniques for a more detailed explanation.

   All Qt programs automatically support the following command line
   options:
     * -style= style, sets the application GUI style. Possible values are
       motif, windows, and platinum. If you compiled Qt with additional
       styles or have additional styles as plugins these will be
       available to the -style command line option.
     * -style style, is the same as listed above.
     * -session= session, restores the application from an earlier
       session.
     * -session session, is the same as listed above.
     * -widgetcount, prints debug message at the end about number of
       widgets left undestroyed and maximum number of widgets existed at
       the same time

   The X11 version of Qt also supports some traditional X11 command line
   options:
     * -display display, sets the X display (default is $DISPLAY).
     * -geometry geometry, sets the client geometry of the first window
       that is shown.
     * -fn or -font font, defines the application font. The font should
       be specified using an X logical font description.
     * -bg or -background color, sets the default background color and an
       application palette (light and dark shades are calculated).
     * -fg or -foreground color, sets the default foreground color.
     * -btn or -button color, sets the default button color.
     * -name name, sets the application name.
     * -title title, sets the application title.
     * -visual TrueColor, forces the application to use a TrueColor
       visual on an 8-bit display.
     * -ncols count, limits the number of colors allocated in the color
       cube on an 8-bit display, if the application is using the
       QApplication::ManyColor color specification. If count is 216 then
       a 6x6x6 color cube is used (i.e. 6 levels of red, 6 of green, and
       6 of blue); for other values, a cube approximately proportional to
       a 2x3x1 cube is used.
     * -cmap, causes the application to install a private color map on an
       8-bit display.

   See also argc() and argv().

  QApplication::QApplication ( int & argc, char ** argv, bool GUIenabled )

   Constructs an application object with argc command line arguments in
   argv. If GUIenabled is true, a GUI application is constructed,
   otherwise a non-GUI (console) application is created.

   Set GUIenabled to false for programs without a graphical user
   interface that should be able to run without a window system.

   On X11, the window system is initialized if GUIenabled is true. If
   GUIenabled is false, the application does not connect to the X server.
   On Windows and Macintosh, currently the window system is always
   initialized, regardless of the value of GUIenabled. This may change in
   future versions of Qt.

   The following example shows how to create an application that uses a
   graphical interface when available.
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
    #ifdef Q_WS_X11
        bool useGUI = getenv("DISPLAY") != 0;
    #else
        bool useGUI = true;
    #endif
        QApplication app(argc, argv, useGUI);

        if (useGUI) {
           // start GUI version
           ...
        } else {
           // start non-GUI version
           ...
        }
        return app.exec();
    }

  QApplication::QApplication ( int & argc, char ** argv, Type type )

   Constructs an application object with argc command line arguments in
   argv.

   For Qt/Embedded, passing QApplication::GuiServer for type makes this
   application the server (equivalent to running with the -qws option).

  QApplication::QApplication ( Display * dpy, Qt::HANDLE visual = 0, Qt::HANDLE
  colormap = 0 )

   Create an application, given an already open display dpy. If visual
   and colormap are non-zero, the application will use those as the
   default Visual and Colormap contexts.

   Warning: Qt only supports TrueColor visuals at depths higher than 8
   bits-per-pixel.

   This is available only on X11.

  QApplication::QApplication ( Display * dpy, int & argc, char ** argv,
  Qt::HANDLE visual = 0, Qt::HANDLE colormap = 0 )

   Create an application, given an already open display dpy and using
   argc command line arguments in argv. If visual and colormap are
   non-zero, the application will use those as the default Visual and
   Colormap contexts.

   Warning: Qt only supports TrueColor visuals at depths higher than 8
   bits-per-pixel.

   This is available only on X11.

  QApplication::~QApplication ()   [virtual]

   Cleans up any window system resources that were allocated by this
   application. Sets the global variable qApp to 0.

  void QApplication::aboutQt ()   [static slot]

   Displays a simple message box about Qt. The message includes the
   version number of Qt being used by the application.

   This is useful for inclusion in the Help menu of an application. See
   the examples/menu/menu.cpp example.

   This function is a convenience slot for QMessageBox::aboutQt().

  QWidget * QApplication::activeModalWidget ()   [static]

   Returns the active modal widget.

   A modal widget is a special top-level widget which is a subclass of
   QDialog that specifies the modal parameter of the constructor as true.
   A modal widget must be closed before the user can continue with other
   parts of the program.

   Modal widgets are organized in a stack. This function returns the
   active modal widget at the top of the stack.

   See also activePopupWidget() and topLevelWidgets().

  QWidget * QApplication::activePopupWidget ()   [static]

   Returns the active popup widget.

   A popup widget is a special top-level widget that sets the
   Qt::WType_Popup widget flag, e.g. the QMenu widget. When the
   application opens a popup widget, all events are sent to the popup.
   Normal widgets and modal widgets cannot be accessed before the popup
   widget is closed.

   Only other popup widgets may be opened when a popup widget is shown.
   The popup widgets are organized in a stack. This function returns the
   active popup widget at the top of the stack.

   See also activeModalWidget() and topLevelWidgets().

  QWidget * QApplication::activeWindow ()   [static]

   Returns the application top-level window that has the keyboard input
   focus, or 0 if no application window has the focus. Note that there
   might be an activeWindow() even if there is no focusWidget(), for
   example if no widget in that window accepts key events.

   See also QWidget::setFocus(), QWidget::hasFocus(), and focusWidget().

  QWidgetList QApplication::allWidgets ()   [static]

   Returns a list of all the widgets in the application.

   The list is empty (QList::isEmpty()) if there are no widgets.

   Note that some of the widgets may be hidden.

   Example:
    void updateAllWidgets()
    {
        foreach (QWidget *widget, QApplication::allWidgets())
            widget->update();
    }

   See also topLevelWidgets() and QWidget::isVisible().

  void QApplication::beep ()   [static]

   Sounds the bell, using the default volume and sound.

  void QApplication::changeOverrideCursor ( const QCursor & cursor )   [static]

   Changes the currently active application override cursor to cursor.

   This function has no effect if setOverrideCursor() wasn't called.

   See also setOverrideCursor(), overrideCursor(),
   restoreOverrideCursor(), and QWidget::setCursor().

  QClipboard * QApplication::clipboard ()   [static]

   Returns a pointer to the application global clipboard.

  void QApplication::closeAllWindows ()   [static slot]

   Closes all top-level windows.

   This function is particularly useful for applications with many
   top-level windows. It could, for example, be connected to a Exit entry
   in the File menu:
        exitAct = new QAction(tr("E&xit"), this);
        exitAct->setShortcut(tr("Ctrl+Q"));
        exitAct->setStatusTip(tr("Exit the application"));
        connect(exitAct, SIGNAL(triggered()), qApp, SLOT(closeAllWindows()));

   The windows are closed in random order, until one window does not
   accept the close event. The application quits when the last window was
   successfully closed. This can be turned of by setting
   quitOnLastWindowClosed to false.

   See also quitOnLastWindowClosed, lastWindowClosed(), QWidget::close(),
   QWidget::closeEvent(), lastWindowClosed(), quit(), topLevelWidgets(),
   and QWidget::isWindow().

  int QApplication::colorSpec ()   [static]

   Returns the color specification.

   See also QApplication::setColorSpec().

  void QApplication::commitData ( QSessionManager & manager )   [virtual]

   This function deals with session management. It is invoked when the
   QSessionManager wants the application to commit all its data.

   Usually this means saving all open files, after getting permission
   from the user. Furthermore you may want to provide a means by which
   the user can cancel the shutdown.

   Note that you should not exit the application within this function.
   Instead, the session manager may or may not do this afterwards,
   depending on the context.

   Warning: Within this function, no user interaction is possible, unless
   you ask the session manager manager for explicit permission. See
   QSessionManager::allowsInteraction() and
   QSessionManager::allowsErrorInteraction() for details and example
   usage.

   The default implementation requests interaction and sends a close
   event to all visible top-level widgets. If any event was rejected, the
   shutdown is canceled.

   See also isSessionRestored(), sessionId(), saveState(), and Session
   Management.

  QDesktopWidget * QApplication::desktop ()   [static]

   Returns the desktop widget (also called the root window).

   The desktop widget is useful for obtaining the size of the screen. It
   may also be possible to draw on the desktop. We recommend against
   assuming that it's possible to draw on the desktop, since this does
   not work on all operating systems.

   Example:
    QDesktopWidget *desktop = QApplication::desktop();
    int width = desktop->width();
    int height = desktop->height();

  bool QApplication::desktopSettingsAware ()   [static]

   Returns true if Qt is set to use the system's standard colors, fonts,
   etc.; otherwise returns false. The default is true.

   See also setDesktopSettingsAware().

  int QApplication::exec ()   [static]

   Enters the main event loop and waits until exit() is called or the
   main widget is destroyed, and returns the value that was set to exit()
   (which is 0 if exit() is called via quit()).

   It is necessary to call this function to start event handling. The
   main event loop receives events from the window system and dispatches
   these to the application widgets.

   Generally speaking, no user interaction can take place before calling
   exec(). As a special case, modal widgets like QMessageBox can be used
   before calling exec(), because modal widgets call exec() to start a
   local event loop.

   To make your application perform idle processing, i.e. executing a
   special function whenever there are no pending events, use a QTimer
   with 0 timeout. More advanced idle processing schemes can be achieved
   using processEvents().

   See also quitOnLastWindowClosed, quit(), exit(), processEvents(), and
   QCoreApplication::exec().

  QWidget * QApplication::focusWidget ()   [static]

   Returns the application widget that has the keyboard input focus, or 0
   if no widget in this application has the focus.

   See also QWidget::setFocus(), QWidget::hasFocus(), and activeWindow().

  QFont QApplication::font ( const QWidget * w = 0 )   [static]

   Returns the default font for the widget w, or the default application
   font if w is 0.

   See also setFont(), fontMetrics(), and QWidget::font().

  QFontMetrics QApplication::fontMetrics ()   [static]

   Returns display (screen) font metrics for the application font.

   See also font(), setFont(), QWidget::fontMetrics(), and
   QPainter::fontMetrics().

  QInputContext * QApplication::inputContext () const

   Returns the QInputContext instance used by the application.

   See also setInputContext().

  bool QApplication::isEffectEnabled ( Qt::UIEffect effect )   [static]

   Returns true if effect is enabled; otherwise returns false.

   By default, Qt will try to use the desktop settings. Call
   setDesktopSettingsAware(false) to prevent this.

   Note: All effects are disabled on screens running at less than 16-bit
   color depth.

   See also setEffectEnabled() and Qt::UIEffect.

  bool QApplication::isLeftToRight ()   [static]

   Returns true if the application's layout direction is Qt::LeftToRight;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also layoutDirection() and isRightToLeft().

  bool QApplication::isRightToLeft ()   [static]

   Returns true if the application's layout direction is Qt::RightToLeft;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also layoutDirection() and isLeftToRight().

  bool QApplication::isSessionRestored () const

   Returns true if the application has been restored from an earlier
   session; otherwise returns false.

   See also sessionId(), commitData(), and saveState().

  Qt::KeyboardModifiers QApplication::keyboardModifiers ()   [static]

   Returns the current state of the modifier keys on the keyboard. The
   current state is updated sychronously as the event queue is emptied of
   events that will spontaneously change the keyboard state
   (QEvent::KeyPress and QEvent::KeyRelease events).

   It should be noted this may not reflect the actual keys held on the
   input device at the time of calling but rather the modifiers as last
   reported in one of the above events. If no keys are being held
   Qt::NoModifier is returned.

   See also mouseButtons().

  void QApplication::lastWindowClosed ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the user has closed the last top-level
   window.

   By default QApplication implicitely quits when this signal is emitted.
   This feature be turned off by setting quitOnLastWindowClosed to false.

   Only top-level windows with the Qt::WA_QuitOnClose attribute set are
   taken into account. For convenience, this attribute is not set for
   transient top-level widgets such as splash screens, popup menus, and
   dialogs.

   See also QWidget::close().

  bool QApplication::macEventFilter ( EventHandlerCallRef caller, EventRef
  event )   [virtual]

   Warning: This virtual function is only implemented under Mac OS X.

   If you create an application that inherits QApplication and
   reimplement this function, you get direct access to all Carbon Events
   that are received from Mac OS X with this function being called with
   the caller and the event.

   Return true if you want to stop the event from being processed. Return
   false for normal event dispatching. The default implementation returns
   false.

  Qt::MouseButtons QApplication::mouseButtons ()   [static]

   Returns the current state of the buttons on the mouse. The current
   state is updated syncronously as the event queue is emptied of events
   that will spontaneously change the mouse state (QEvent::MousePress and
   QEvent::MouseRelease events).

   It should be noted this may not reflect the actual buttons held on
   theinput device at the time of calling but rather the mouse buttons as
   last reported in one of the above events. If no mouse buttons rae
   being held Qt::NoButton is returned.

   See also keyboardModifiers().

  QCursor * QApplication::overrideCursor ()   [static]

   Returns the active application override cursor.

   This function returns 0 if no application cursor has been defined
   (i.e. the internal cursor stack is empty).

   See also setOverrideCursor() and restoreOverrideCursor().

  QPalette QApplication::palette ()   [static]

   Returns the application palette.

   See also setPalette() and QWidget::palette().

  QPalette QApplication::palette ( const QWidget * w )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   If a widget is passed in w, the default palette for the widget's class
   is returned. This may or may not be the application palette. In most
   cases there isn't a special palette for certain types of widgets, but
   one notable exception is the popup menu under Windows, if the user has
   defined a special background color for menus in the display settings.

   See also setPalette() and QWidget::palette().

  QPalette QApplication::palette ( const char * className )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the palette for widgets of the given className.

   See also setPalette() and QWidget::palette().

  QDecoration & QApplication::qwsDecoration ()   [static]

   Return the QWSDecoration used for decorating windows.

   This method is non-portable. It is available only in Qt/Embedded.

   See also QDecoration.

  bool QApplication::qwsEventFilter ( QWSEvent * event )   [virtual]

   Warning: This virtual function is only implemented under Qt/Embedded.

   If you create an application that inherits QApplication and
   reimplement this function, you get direct access to all QWS (Q Window
   System) events that the are received from the QWS master process. The
   events are passed in the event parameter.

   Return true if you want to stop the event from being processed. Return
   false for normal event dispatching. The default implementation returns
   false.

  void QApplication::qwsSetCustomColors ( QRgb * colorTable, int start, int
  numColors )

   Set Qt/Embedded custom color table.

   Qt/Embedded on 8-bpp displays allocates a standard 216 color cube. The
   remaining 40 colors may be used by setting a custom color table in the
   QWS master process before any clients connect.

   colorTable is an array of up to 40 custom colors. start is the
   starting index (0-39) and numColors is the number of colors to be set
   (1-40).

   This method is non-portable. It is available only in Qt/Embedded.

  void QApplication::qwsSetDecoration ( QDecoration * dec )   [static]

   Set the QWSDecoration derived class to use for decorating the
   Qt/Embedded windows to dec.

   This method is non-portable. It is available only in Qt/Embedded.

   See also QDecoration.

  QDecoration * QApplication::qwsSetDecoration ( const QString & decoration )
  [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Requests a QDecoration object for decoration from the
   QDecorationFactory.

   The string must be one of the QStyleFactory::keys().

   A later call to the QApplication constructor will override the
   requested style when a "-style" option is passed in as a commandline
   parameter.

   Returns 0 if an unknown decoration is passed, otherwise the QStyle
   object returned is set as the application's GUI style.

  void QApplication::restoreOverrideCursor ()   [static]

   Undoes the last setOverrideCursor().

   If setOverrideCursor() has been called twice, calling
   restoreOverrideCursor() will activate the first cursor set. Calling
   this function a second time restores the original widgets' cursors.

   See also setOverrideCursor() and overrideCursor().

  void QApplication::saveState ( QSessionManager & manager )   [virtual]

   This function deals with session management. It is invoked when the
   session manager wants the application to preserve its state for a
   future session.

   For example, a text editor would create a temporary file that includes
   the current contents of its edit buffers, the location of the cursor
   and other aspects of the current editing session.

   Note that you should never exit the application within this function.
   Instead, the session manager may or may not do this afterwards,
   depending on the context. Futhermore, most session managers will very
   likely request a saved state immediately after the application has
   been started. This permits the session manager to learn about the
   application's restart policy.

   Warning: Within this function, no user interaction is possible, unless
   you ask the session manager manager for explicit permission. See
   QSessionManager::allowsInteraction() and
   QSessionManager::allowsErrorInteraction() for details.

   See also isSessionRestored(), sessionId(), commitData(), and Session
   Management.

  QString QApplication::sessionId () const

   Returns the current session's identifier.

   If the application has been restored from an earlier session, this
   identifier is the same as it was in that previous session.

   The session identifier is guaranteed to be unique both for different
   applications and for different instances of the same application.

   See also isSessionRestored(), sessionKey(), commitData(), and
   saveState().

  QString QApplication::sessionKey () const

   Returns the session key in the current session.

   If the application has been restored from an earlier session, this key
   is the same as it was when the previous session ended.

   The session key changes with every call of commitData() or
   saveState().

   See also isSessionRestored(), sessionId(), commitData(), and
   saveState().

  void QApplication::setActiveWindow ( QWidget * act )   [static]

   Sets the active window to the act widget in response to a system
   event. The function is called from the platform specific event
   handlers.

   Warning: This function does not set the keyboard focus to the active
   widget. Call QWidget::activateWindow() instead.

   It sets the activeWindow() and focusWidget() attributes and sends
   proper WindowActivate/WindowDeactivate and FocusIn/FocusOut events to
   all appropriate widgets. The window will then be painted in active
   state (e.g. cursors in line edits will blink), and it will have tool
   tips enabled.

   See also activeWindow() and QWidget::activateWindow().

  void QApplication::setColorSpec ( int spec )   [static]

   Sets the color specification for the application to spec.

   The color specification controls how the application allocates colors
   when run on a display with a limited amount of colors, e.g. 8 bit /
   256 color displays.

   The color specification must be set before you create the QApplication
   object.

   The options are:
     * QApplication::NormalColor. This is the default color allocation
       strategy. Use this option if your application uses buttons, menus,
       texts and pixmaps with few colors. With this option, the
       application uses system global colors. This works fine for most
       applications under X11, but on Windows machines it may cause
       dithering of non-standard colors.
     * QApplication::CustomColor. Use this option if your application
       needs a small number of custom colors. On X11, this option is the
       same as NormalColor. On Windows, Qt creates a Windows palette, and
       allocates colors to it on demand.
     * QApplication::ManyColor. Use this option if your application is
       very color hungry (e.g. it requires thousands of colors). Under
       X11 the effect is:
          + For 256-color displays which have at best a 256 color true
            color visual, the default visual is used, and colors are
            allocated from a color cube. The color cube is the 6x6x6 (216
            color) "Web palette" (the red, green, and blue components
            always have one of the following values: 0x00, 0x33, 0x66,
            0x99, 0xCC, or 0xFF), but the number of colors can be changed
            by the -ncols option. The user can force the application to
            use the true color visual with the -visual option.
          + For 256-color displays which have a true color visual with
            more than 256 colors, use that visual. Silicon Graphics X
            servers have this feature, for example. They provide an 8 bit
            visual by default but can deliver true color when asked.
       On Windows, Qt creates a Windows palette, and fills it with a
       color cube.

   Be aware that the CustomColor and ManyColor choices may lead to
   colormap flashing: The foreground application gets (most) of the
   available colors, while the background windows will look less
   attractive.

   Example:
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        QApplication::setColorSpec(QApplication::ManyColor);
        QApplication app(argc, argv);
        ...
        return app.exec();
    }

   See also colorSpec().

  void QApplication::setDesktopSettingsAware ( bool on )   [static]

   Sets whether Qt should use the system's standard colors, fonts, etc.,
   to on. By default, this is true.

   This function must be called before creating the QApplication object,
   like this:
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        QApplication::setDesktopSettingsAware(false);
        QApplication app(argc, argv);
        ...
        return app.exec();
    }

   See also desktopSettingsAware().

  void QApplication::setEffectEnabled ( Qt::UIEffect effect, bool enable = true
  )   [static]

   Enables the UI effect effect if enable is true, otherwise the effect
   will not be used.

   Note: All effects are disabled on screens running at less than 16-bit
   color depth.

   See also isEffectEnabled(), Qt::UIEffect, and
   setDesktopSettingsAware().

  void QApplication::setFont ( const QFont & font, const char * className = 0
  )   [static]

   Changes the default application font to font. If className is passed,
   the change applies only to classes that inherit className (as reported
   by QObject::inherits()).

   On application start-up, the default font depends on the window
   system. It can vary depending on both the window system version and
   the locale. This function lets you override the default font; but
   overriding may be a bad idea because, for example, some locales need
   extra-large fonts to support their special characters.

   See also font(), fontMetrics(), and QWidget::setFont().

  void QApplication::setInputContext ( QInputContext * inputContext )

   This function replaces the QInputContext instance used by the
   application with inputContext.

   See also inputContext().

  void QApplication::setOverrideCursor ( const QCursor & cursor )   [static]

   Sets the application override cursor to cursor.

   Application override cursors are intended for showing the user that
   the application is in a special state, for example during an operation
   that might take some time.

   This cursor will be displayed in all the application's widgets until
   restoreOverrideCursor() or another setOverrideCursor() is called.

   Application cursors are stored on an internal stack.
   setOverrideCursor() pushes the cursor onto the stack, and
   restoreOverrideCursor() pops the active cursor off the stack.
   changeOverrideCursor() changes the curently active application
   override cursor. Every setOverrideCursor() must eventually be followed
   by a corresponding restoreOverrideCursor(), otherwise the stack will
   never be emptied.

   Example:
    QApplication::setOverrideCursor(QCursor(Qt::WaitCursor));
    calculateHugeMandelbrot();              // lunch time...
    QApplication::restoreOverrideCursor();

   See also overrideCursor(), restoreOverrideCursor(),
   changeOverrideCursor(), and QWidget::setCursor().

  void QApplication::setPalette ( const QPalette & palette, const char *
  className = 0 )   [static]

   Changes the default application palette to palette.

   If className is passed, the change applies only to widgets that
   inherit className (as reported by QObject::inherits()). If className
   is left 0, the change affects all widgets, thus overriding any
   previously set class specific palettes.

   The palette may be changed according to the current GUI style in
   QStyle::polish().

   See also QWidget::setPalette(), palette(), and QStyle::polish().

  void QApplication::setStyle ( QStyle * style )   [static]

   Sets the application's GUI style to style. Ownership of the style
   object is transferred to QApplication, so QApplication will delete the
   style object on application exit or when a new style is set.

   Example usage:
    QApplication::setStyle(new QWindowsStyle);

   When switching application styles, the color palette is set back to
   the initial colors or the system defaults. This is necessary since
   certain styles have to adapt the color palette to be fully style-guide
   compliant.

   See also style(), QStyle, setPalette(), and desktopSettingsAware().

  QStyle * QApplication::setStyle ( const QString & style )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Requests a QStyle object for style from the QStyleFactory.

   The string must be one of the QStyleFactory::keys(), typically one of
   "windows", "motif", "cde", "plastique", "windowsxp", or "macintosh".

   Returns 0 if an unknown style is passed, otherwise the QStyle object
   returned is set as the application's GUI style.

  QStyle * QApplication::style ()   [static]

   Returns the application's style object.

   See also setStyle() and QStyle.

  void QApplication::syncX ()   [static]

   Synchronizes with the X server in the X11 implementation. This
   normally takes some time. Does nothing on other platforms.

  QWidget * QApplication::topLevelAt ( const QPoint & p )   [static]

   Returns the top-level widget at the point p.

  QWidget * QApplication::topLevelAt ( int x, int y )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the top-level widget at the point (x, y).

  QWidgetList QApplication::topLevelWidgets ()   [static]

   Returns a list of the top-level widgets (windows) in the application.

   Note that some of the top-level widgets may be hidden, for example a
   tooltip if no tooltip is currently shown.

   Example:
    void showAllHiddenTopLevelWidgets()
    {
        foreach (QWidget *widget, QApplication::topLevelWidgets()) {
            if (widget->isHidden())
                widget->show();
        }
    }

   See also allWidgets(), QWidget::isWindow(), and QWidget::isHidden().

  Type QApplication::type ()   [static]

   Returns the type of application (Tty, GuiClient, or GuiServer). The
   type is set when constructing the QApplication object.

  QWidget * QApplication::widgetAt ( const QPoint & p )   [static]

   Returns the widget at global screen position p, or 0 if there is no Qt
   widget there.

   This function can be slow.

   See also QCursor::pos(), QWidget::grabMouse(), and
   QWidget::grabKeyboard().

  QWidget * QApplication::widgetAt ( int x, int y )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the widget at global screen position (x, y), or 0 if there is
   no Qt widget there.

  void QApplication::winFocus ( QWidget * widget, bool gotFocus )

   If gotFocus is true, widget will become the active window. Otherwise
   the active window is reset to NULL.

  bool QApplication::x11EventFilter ( XEvent * event )   [virtual]

   Warning: This virtual function is only implemented under X11.

   If you create an application that inherits QApplication and
   reimplement this function, you get direct access to all X events that
   the are received from the X server. The events are passed in the event
   parameter.

   Return true if you want to stop the event from being processed. Return
   false for normal event dispatching. THe default implementation returns
   false.

   See also x11ProcessEvent().

  int QApplication::x11ProcessEvent ( XEvent * event )

   This function does the core processing of individual X events,
   normally by dispatching Qt events to the right destination.

   It returns 1 if the event was consumed by special handling, 0 if the
   event was consumed by normal handling, and -1 if the event was for an
   unrecognized widget.

   See also x11EventFilter().
