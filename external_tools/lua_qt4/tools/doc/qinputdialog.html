Detailed Description

   The QInputDialog class provides a simple convenience dialog to get a
   single value from the user.

   The input value can be a string, a number or an item from a list. A
   label must be set to tell the user what they should enter.

   Four static convenience functions are provided: getText(),
   getInteger(), getDouble() and getItem(). All the functions can be used
   in a similar way, for example:
        bool ok;
        QString text = QInputDialog::getText(this, tr("QInputDialog::getText()"
),
                                             tr("User name:"), QLineEdit::Norma
l,
                                             QDir::home().dirName(), &ok);
        if (ok && !text.isEmpty())
            textLabel->setText(text);

   The ok variable is set to true if the user clicks OK; otherwise it is
   set to false.

                               Input Dialogs

   The Standard Dialogs example shows how to use QInputDialog as well as
   other built-in Qt dialogs.

   See also QMessageBox.

Member Function Documentation

  double QInputDialog::getDouble ( QWidget * parent, const QString & title,
  const QString & label, double value = 0, double minValue = -2147483647,
  double maxValue = 2147483647, int decimals = 1, bool * ok = 0, Qt::WFlags f =
  0 )   [static]

   Static convenience function to get a floating point number from the
   user. title is the text which is displayed in the title bar of the
   dialog. label is the text which is shown to the user (it should say
   what should be entered). value is the default floating point number
   that the line edit will be set to. minValue and maxValue are the
   minimum and maximum values the user may choose, and decimals is the
   maximum number of decimal places the number may have.

   If ok is non-null, *ok will be set to true if the user pressed OK and
   to false if the user pressed Cancel. The dialog's parent is parent.
   The dialog will be modal and uses the widget flags f.

   This function returns the floating point number which has been entered
   by the user.

   Use this static function like this:
        bool ok;
        double d = QInputDialog::getDouble(this, tr("QInputDialog::getDouble()"
),
                                           tr("Amount:"), 37.56, -10000, 10000,
 2, &ok);
        if (ok)
            doubleLabel->setText(QString("$%1").arg(d));

   See also getText(), getInteger(), and getItem().

  int QInputDialog::getInteger ( QWidget * parent, const QString & title, const
  QString & label, int value = 0, int minValue = -2147483647, int maxValue =
  2147483647, int step = 1, bool * ok = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )   [static]

   Static convenience function to get an integer input from the user.
   title is the text which is displayed in the title bar of the dialog.
   label is the text which is shown to the user (it should say what
   should be entered). value is the default integer which the spinbox
   will be set to. minValue and maxValue are the minimum and maximum
   values the user may choose, and step is the amount by which the values
   change as the user presses the arrow buttons to increment or decrement
   the value.

   If ok is non-null *ok will be set to true if the user pressed OK and
   to false if the user pressed Cancel. The dialog's parent is parent.
   The dialog will be modal and uses the widget flags f.

   This function returns the integer which has been entered by the user.

   Use this static function like this:
        bool ok;
        int i = QInputDialog::getInteger(this, tr("QInputDialog::getInteger()")
,
                                         tr("Percentage:"), 25, 0, 100, 1, &ok)
;
        if (ok)
            integerLabel->setText(tr("%1%").arg(i));

   See also getText(), getDouble(), and getItem().

  QString QInputDialog::getItem ( QWidget * parent, const QString & title,
  const QString & label, const QStringList & list, int current = 0, bool
  editable = true, bool * ok = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )   [static]

   Static convenience function to let the user select an item from a
   string list. title is the text which is displayed in the title bar of
   the dialog. label is the text which is shown to the user (it should
   say what should be entered). list is the string list which is inserted
   into the combobox, and current is the number of the item which should
   be the current item. If editable is true the user can enter their own
   text; if editable is false the user may only select one of the
   existing items.

   If ok is non-null *a ok will be set to true if the user pressed OK and
   to false if the user pressed Cancel. The dialog's parent is parent.
   The dialog will be modal and uses the widget flags f.

   This function returns the text of the current item, or if editable is
   true, the current text of the combobox.

   Use this static function like this:
        QStringList items;
        items << tr("Spring") << tr("Summer") << tr("Fall") << tr("Winter");

        bool ok;
        QString item = QInputDialog::getItem(this, tr("QInputDialog::getItem()"
),
                                             tr("Season:"), items, 0, false, &o
k);
        if (ok && !item.isEmpty())
            itemLabel->setText(item);

   See also getText(), getInteger(), and getDouble().

  QString QInputDialog::getText ( QWidget * parent, const QString & title,
  const QString & label, QLineEdit::EchoMode mode = QLineEdit::Normal, const
  QString & text = QString(), bool * ok = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )   [static]

   Static convenience function to get a string from the user. title is
   the text which is displayed in the title bar of the dialog. label is
   the text which is shown to the user (it should say what should be
   entered). text is the default text which is placed in the line edit.
   The mode is the echo mode the line edit will use. If ok is non-null *a
   ok will be set to true if the user pressed OK and to false if the user
   pressed Cancel. The dialog's parent is parent. The dialog will be
   modal and uses the widget flags f.

   This function returns the text which has been entered in the line
   edit. It will not return an empty string.

   Use this static function like this:
        bool ok;
        QString text = QInputDialog::getText(this, tr("QInputDialog::getText()"
),
                                             tr("User name:"), QLineEdit::Norma
l,
                                             QDir::home().dirName(), &ok);
        if (ok && !text.isEmpty())
            textLabel->setText(text);
