Detailed Description

   The QMutex class provides access serialization between threads.

   The purpose of a QMutex is to protect an object, data structure or
   section of code so that only one thread can access it at a time (this
   is similar to the Java synchronized keyword). It is usually best to
   use a mutex with a QMutexLocker since this makes it easy to ensure
   that locking and unlocking are performed consistently.

   For example, say there is a method that prints a message to the user
   on two lines:
    int number = 6;

    void method1()
    {
        number *= 5;
        number /= 4;
    }

    void method2()
    {
        number *= 3;
        number /= 2;
    }

   If these two methods are called in succession, the following happens:
    // method1()
    number *= 5;        // number is now 30
    number /= 4;        // number is now 7

    // method2()
    number *= 3;        // nubmer is now 21
    number /= 2;        // number is now 10

   If these two methods are called simultaneously from two threads then
   the following sequence could result:
    // Thread 1 calls method1()
    number *= 5;        // number is now 30

    // Thread 2 calls method2().
    //
    // Most likely Thread 1 has been put to sleep by the operating
    // system to allow Thread 2 to run.
    number *= 3;        // number is now 90
    number /= 2;        // number is now 45

    // Thread 1 finishes executing.
    number /= 4;        // number is now 11, instead of 10

   If we add a mutex, we should get the result we want:
    QMutex mutex;
    int number = 6;

    void method1()
    {
        mutex.lock();
        number *= 5;
        number /= 4;
        mutex.unlock();
    }

    void method2()
    {
        mutex.lock();
        number *= 3;
        number /= 2;
        mutex.unlock();
    }

   Then only one thread can modify number at any given time and the
   result is correct. This is a trivial example, of course, but applies
   to any other case where things need to happen in a particular
   sequence.

   When you call lock() in a thread, other threads that try to call
   lock() in the same place will block until the thread that got the lock
   calls unlock(). A non-blocking alternative to lock() is tryLock().

   See also QMutexLocker, QReadWriteLock, QSemaphore, and QWaitCondition.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QMutex::RecursionMode

   Constant Value Description
   QMutex::Recursive 1 In this mode, a thread can lock the same mutex
   multiple times and the mutex won't be unlocked until a corresponding
   number of unlock() calls have been made.
   QMutex::NonRecursive 0 In this mode, a thread may only lock a mutex
   once.

   See also QMutex().

Member Function Documentation

  QMutex::QMutex ( RecursionMode mode = NonRecursive )

   Constructs a new mutex. The mutex is created in an unlocked state.

   If mode is QMutex::Recursive, a thread can lock the same mutex
   multiple times and the mutex won't be unlocked until a corresponding
   number of unlock() calls have been made. The default is
   QMutex::NonRecursive.

   See also lock() and unlock().

  QMutex::~QMutex ()

   Destroys the mutex.

   Warning: Destroying a locked mutex may result in undefined behavior.

  void QMutex::lock ()

   Locks the mutex. If another thread has locked the mutex then this call
   will block until that thread has unlocked it.

   See also unlock().

  bool QMutex::tryLock ()

   Attempts to lock the mutex. If the lock was obtained, this function
   returns true. If another thread has locked the mutex, this function
   returns false immediately.

   If the lock was obtained, the mutex must be unlocked with unlock()
   before another thread can successfully lock it.

   See also lock() and unlock().

  void QMutex::unlock ()

   Unlocks the mutex. Attempting to unlock a mutex in a different thread
   to the one that locked it results in an error. Unlocking a mutex that
   is not locked results in undefined behavior.

   See also lock().
