Detailed Description

   The QProgressBar widget provides a horizontal progress bar.

   A progress bar is used to give the user an indication of the progress
   of an operation and to reassure them that the application is still
   running.

   The progress bar uses the concept of steps. You set it up by
   specifying the minumum and maximum possible step values, and it will
   display the percentage of steps that have been completed when you
   later give it the current step value. The percentage is calculated by
   dividing the progress (value() - minimum()) divided by maximum() -
   minimum().

   You can specify the minimum and maximum number of steps with
   setMinimum() and setMaximum. The current number of steps is set with
   setValue(). The progress bar can be rewound to the beginning with
   reset().

   If minimum and maximum both are set to 0, the bar shows a busy
   indicator instead of a percentage of steps. This is useful, for
   example, when using QFtp or QHttp to download items when they are
   unable to determine the size of the item being downloaded.

Property Documentation

  alignment : Qt::Alignment

   This property holds the alignment of the progress bar.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::Alignment alignment () const
     * void setAlignment ( Qt::Alignment alignment )

  maximum : int

   This property holds the progress bar's maximum value.

   When setting this property, the minimum is adjusted if necessary to
   ensure that the range remains valid. If the current value falls
   outside the new range, the progressbar is reset with reset().

   Access functions:
     * int maximum () const
     * void setMaximum ( int maximum )

  minimum : int

   This property holds the progress bar's minimum value.

   When setting this property, the maximum is adjusted if necessary to
   ensure that the range remains valid. If the current value falls
   outside the new range, the progressbar is reset with reset().

   Access functions:
     * int minimum () const
     * void setMinimum ( int minimum )

  text : const QString

   This property holds the descriptive text shown with the progress bar.

   The text returned is the same as the text displayed in the center (or
   in some styles, to the left) of the progress bar.

   The progress shown in the text may be smaller than the minimum value,
   indicating that the progress bar is in the "reset" state before any
   progress is set.

   In the default implementation, the text either contains a percentage
   value that indicates the progress so far, or it is blank because the
   progress bar is in the reset state.

   Access functions:
     * virtual QString text () const

  textVisible : bool

   This property holds whether the current completed percentage should be
   displayed.

   Access functions:
     * bool isTextVisible () const
     * void setTextVisible ( bool visible )

  value : int

   This property holds the progressbar's current value.

   Attemting to change the current value to one outside the
   minimum-maximum range has no effect the current value.

   Access functions:
     * int value () const
     * void setValue ( int value )

Member Function Documentation

  QProgressBar::QProgressBar ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a progress bar with the given parent.

   By default, the minimum step value is set to 0, and the maximum to
   100.

   See also setRange().

  void QProgressBar::reset ()   [slot]

   Reset the progress bar. The progress bar "rewinds" and shows no
   progress.

  void QProgressBar::setRange ( int minimum, int maximum )

   Sets the progressbar's minimum and maximum values to minimum and
   maximum respectively.

   If maximum is smaller than minimum, minimum becomes the only legal
   value.

   If the current value falls outside the new range, the progressbar is
   reset with reset().

   See also minimum and maximum.

  void QProgressBar::valueChanged ( int value )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the value shown in the progress bar
   changes. value is the new value shown by the progress bar.
