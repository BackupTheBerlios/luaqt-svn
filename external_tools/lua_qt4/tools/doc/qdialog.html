Detailed Description

   The QDialog class is the base class of dialog windows.

   A dialog window is a top-level window mostly used for short-term tasks
   and brief communications with the user. QDialogs may be modal or
   modeless. QDialogs support extensibility and can provide a return
   value. They can have default buttons. QDialogs can also have a
   QSizeGrip in their lower-right corner, using setSizeGripEnabled().

   Note that QDialog uses the parent widget slightly differently from
   other classes in Qt. A dialog is always a top-level widget, but if it
   has a parent, its default location is centered on top of the parent's
   top-level widget (if it is not top-level itself). It will also share
   the parent's taskbar entry.

  Modal Dialogs

   A modal dialog is a dialog that blocks input to other visible windows
   in the same application. Users must finish interacting with the dialog
   and close it before they can access any other window in the
   application. Dialogs that are used to request a file name from the
   user or that are used to set application preferences are usually
   modal.

   The most common way to display a modal dialog is to call its exec()
   function. When the user closes the dialog, exec() will provide a
   useful return value. Typically, to get the dialog to close and return
   the appropriate value, we connect a default button, e.g. "OK", to the
   accept() slot and a "Cancel" button to the reject() slot.
   Alternatively you can call the done() slot with Accepted or Rejected.

   An alternative is to call setModal(true), then show(). Unlike exec(),
   show() returns control to the caller immediately. Calling
   setModal(true) is especially useful for progress dialogs, where the
   user must have the ability to interact with the dialog, e.g. to cancel
   a long running operation. If you use show() and setModal(true)
   together you must call QApplication::processEvents() periodically
   during processing to enable the user to interact with the dialog. (See
   QProgressDialog.)

  Modeless Dialogs

   A modeless dialog is a dialog that operates independently of other
   windows in the same application. Find and replace dialogs in
   word-processors are often modeless to allow the user to interact with
   both the application's main window and with the dialog.

   Modeless dialogs are displayed using show(), which returns control to
   the caller immediately.

  Default Button

   A dialog's default button is the button that's pressed when the user
   presses Enter (Return). This button is used to signify that the user
   accepts the dialog's settings and wants to close the dialog. Use
   QPushButton::setDefault(), QPushButton::isDefault() and
   QPushButton::autoDefault() to set and control the dialog's default
   button.

  Escape Key

   If the user presses the Esc key in a dialog, QDialog::reject() will be
   called. This will cause the window to close: The close event cannot be
   ignored.

  Extensibility

   Extensibility is the ability to show the dialog in two ways: a partial
   dialog that shows the most commonly used options, and a full dialog
   that shows all the options. Typically an extensible dialog will
   initially appear as a partial dialog, but with a "More" toggle button.
   If the user presses the "More" button down, the full dialog will
   appear. The extension widget will be resized to its sizeHint(). If
   orientation is Qt::Horizontal the extension widget's height() will be
   expanded to the height() of the dialog. If the orientation is
   Qt::Vertical the extension widget's width() will be expanded to the
   width() of the dialog. Extensibility is controlled with
   setExtension(), setOrientation() and showExtension().

  Return Value (Modal Dialogs)

   Modal dialogs are often used in situations where a return value is
   required, e.g. to indicate whether the user pressed "OK" or "Cancel".
   A dialog can be closed by calling the accept() or the reject() slots,
   and exec() will return Accepted or Rejected as appropriate. The exec()
   call returns the result of the dialog. The result is also available
   from result() if the dialog has not been destroyed.

  Code Examples

   A modal dialog:
    void EditorWindow::countWords()
    {
        WordCountDialog dialog(this);
        dialog.setWordCount(document().wordCount());
        dialog.exec();
    }

   A modeless dialog:
    void EditorWindow::find()
    {
        if (!findDialog) {
            findDialog = new FindDialog(this);
            connect(findDialog, SIGNAL(findNext()), this, SLOT(findNext()));
        }

        findDialog->show();
        findDialog->raise();
        findDialog->activateWindow();
    }

Member Type Documentation

  enum QDialog::DialogCode

   The value returned by a modal dialog.

       Constant      Value
   QDialog::Accepted   1
   QDialog::Rejected   0
     _________________________________________________________________

Property Documentation

  modal : bool

   This property holds whether show() should pop up the dialog as modal
   or modeless.

   By default, this property is false and show() pops up the dialog as
   modeless.

   exec() ignores the value of this property and always pops up the
   dialog as modal.

   Access functions:
     * bool isModal () const
     * void setModal ( bool modal )

   See also show() and exec().

  sizeGripEnabled : bool

   This property holds whether the size grip is enabled.

   A QSizeGrip is placed in the bottom-right corner of the dialog when
   this property is enabled. By default, the size grip is disabled.

   Access functions:
     * bool isSizeGripEnabled () const
     * void setSizeGripEnabled ( bool )

Member Function Documentation

  QDialog::QDialog ( QWidget * parent = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   Constructs a dialog with parent parent.

   A dialog is always a top-level widget, but if it has a parent, its
   default location is centered on top of the parent. It will also share
   the parent's taskbar entry.

   The widget flags f are passed on to the QWidget constructor. If, for
   example, you don't want a What's This button in the title bar of the
   dialog, pass Qt::WStyle_Customize | Qt::WStyle_NormalBorder |
   Qt::WStyle_Title | Qt::WStyle_SysMenu in f.

   See also QWidget::setWindowFlags().

  QDialog::~QDialog ()

   Destroys the QDialog, deleting all its children.

  void QDialog::accept ()   [virtual slot]

   Hides the modal dialog and sets the result code to Accepted.

   See also reject() and done().

  void QDialog::done ( int r )   [virtual slot]

   Closes the dialog and sets its result code to r. If this dialog is
   shown with exec(), done() causes the local event loop to finish, and
   exec() to return r.

   As with QWidget::close(), done() deletes the dialog if the
   Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose flag is set. If the dialog is the application's
   main widget, the application terminates. If the dialog is the last
   window closed, the QApplication::lastWindowClosed() signal is emitted.

   See also accept(), reject(), QApplication::activeWindow(), and
   QApplication::quit().

  int QDialog::exec ()   [slot]

   Shows the dialog as a modal dialog, blocking until the user closes it.
   The function returns a DialogCode result.

   Users cannot interact with any other window in the same application
   until they close the dialog.

   See also show() and result().

  QWidget * QDialog::extension () const

   Returns the dialog's extension or 0 if no extension has been defined.

   See also setExtension().

  Qt::Orientation QDialog::orientation () const

   Returns the dialog's extension orientation.

   See also setOrientation().

  void QDialog::reject ()   [virtual slot]

   Hides the modal dialog and sets the result code to Rejected.

   See also accept() and done().

  int QDialog::result () const

   Returns the modal dialog's result code, Accepted or Rejected.

   Do not call this function if the dialog was constructed with the
   Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose attribute.

  void QDialog::setExtension ( QWidget * extension )

   Sets the widget, extension, to be the dialog's extension, deleting any
   previous extension. The dialog takes ownership of the extension. Note
   that if 0 is passed any existing extension will be deleted.

   This function must only be called while the dialog is hidden.

   See also showExtension(), setOrientation(), and extension().

  void QDialog::setOrientation ( Qt::Orientation orientation )

   If orientation is Qt::Horizontal, the extension will be displayed to
   the right of the dialog's main area. If orientation is Qt::Vertical,
   the extension will be displayed below the dialog's main area.

   See also orientation() and setExtension().

  void QDialog::setResult ( int i )

   Sets the modal dialog's result code to i.

  void QDialog::showExtension ( bool showIt )   [slot]

   If showIt is true, the dialog's extension is shown; otherwise the
   extension is hidden.

   This slot is usually connected to the QPushButton::toggled() signal of
   a QPushButton.

   A dialog with a visible extension is not resizeable.

   See also show(), setExtension(), and setOrientation().
