Detailed Description

   The QSound class provides access to the platform audio facilities.

   Qt provides the most commonly required audio operation in GUI
   applications: asynchronously playing a sound file. This is most easily
   accomplished with a single call:
    QSound::play("mysounds/bells.wav");

   A second API is provided in which a QSound object is created from a
   sound file and is played later:
    QSound bells("mysounds/bells.wav");

    bells.play();

   Sounds played using the second model may use more memory but play more
   immediately than sounds played using the first model, depending on the
   underlying platform audio facilities.

   On Microsoft Windows the underlying multimedia system is used; only
   WAVE format sound files are supported.

   On X11 the Network Audio System is used if available, otherwise all
   operations work silently. NAS supports WAVE and AU files.

   On Mac OS X we use QuickTime for sound. All QuickTime formats are
   supported by Qt/Mac.

   On Qt/Embedded, a built-in mixing sound server is used, which accesses
   /dev/dsp directly. Only the WAVE format is supported.

   The availability of sound can be tested with QSound::isAvailable().

   Note that QSound does not support resources. This might be fixed in a
   future Qt version.

Member Function Documentation

  QSound::QSound ( const QString & filename, QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QSound that can quickly play the sound in a file named
   filename.

   This may use more memory than the static play function.

   The parent argument (default 0) is passed on to the QObject
   constructor.

  QSound::~QSound ()

   Destroys the sound object. If the sound is not finished playing stop()
   is called on it.

   See also stop() and isFinished().

  QString QSound::fileName () const

   Returns the filename associated with the sound.

  bool QSound::isAvailable ()   [static]

   Returns true if sound facilities exist on the platform; otherwise
   returns false. An application may choose either to notify the user if
   sound is crucial to the application or to operate silently without
   bothering the user.

   If no sound is available, all QSound operations work silently and
   quickly.

   Note: On Windows this always returns true because some sound card
   drivers do not implement a way to find out whether it is available or
   not.

  bool QSound::isFinished () const

   Returns true if the sound has finished playing; otherwise returns
   false.

   Warning: On Windows this function always returns true for unlooped
   sounds.

  int QSound::loops () const

   Returns the number of times the sound will play.

  int QSound::loopsRemaining () const

   Returns the number of times the sound will loop. This value decreases
   each time the sound loops.

  void QSound::play ( const QString & filename )   [static]

   Plays the sound in a file called filename.

  void QSound::play ()   [slot]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Starts the sound playing. The function returns immediately. Depending
   on the platform audio facilities, other sounds may stop or may be
   mixed with the new sound.

   The sound can be played again at any time, possibly mixing or
   replacing previous plays of the sound.

  void QSound::setLoops ( int n )

   Sets the sound to repeat n times when it is played. Passing the value
   -1 will cause the sound to loop indefinitely.

   See also loops().

  void QSound::stop ()   [slot]

   Stops the sound playing.

   On Windows the current loop will finish if a sound is played in a
   loop.

   See also play().
