Detailed Description

   The QHBoxLayout class lines up widgets horizontally.

   This class is used to construct horizontal box layout objects. See
   QBoxLayout for details.

   The simplest use of the class is like this:
        QWidget *window = new QWidget;
        QPushButton *button1 = new QPushButton("One");
        QPushButton *button2 = new QPushButton("Two");
        QPushButton *button3 = new QPushButton("Three");
        QPushButton *button4 = new QPushButton("Four");
        QPushButton *button5 = new QPushButton("Five");

        QHBoxLayout *layout = new QHBoxLayout;
        layout->addWidget(button1);
        layout->addWidget(button2);
        layout->addWidget(button3);
        layout->addWidget(button4);
        layout->addWidget(button5);

        window->setLayout(layout);
        window->show();

   First, we create the widgets we want in the layout. Then, we create
   the QHBoxLayout object and add the widgets into the layout. Finally,
   we call QWidget::setLayout() to install the QHBoxLayout object onto
   the widget. At that point, the widgets in the layout are reparented to
   have window as their parent.

               Horizontal box layout with five child widgets

   See also QVBoxLayout, QGridLayout, QStackedLayout, and Layout Classes.
