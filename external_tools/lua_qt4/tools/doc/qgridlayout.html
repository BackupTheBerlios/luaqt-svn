Detailed Description

   The QGridLayout class lays out widgets in a grid.

   QGridLayout takes the space made available to it (by its parent layout
   or by the parentWidget()), divides it up into rows and columns, and
   puts each widget it manages into the correct cell.

   Columns and rows behave identically; we will discuss columns, but
   there are equivalent functions for rows.

   Each column has a minimum width and a stretch factor. The minimum
   width is the greatest of that set using setColumnMinimumWidth() and
   the minimum width of each widget in that column. The stretch factor is
   set using setColumnStretch() and determines how much of the available
   space the column will get over and above its necessary minimum.

   Normally, each managed widget or layout is put into a cell of its own
   using addWidget(). It is also possible for a widget to occupy multiple
   cells using the row and column spanning overloads of addItem() and
   addWidget(). If you do this, QGridLayout will guess how to distribute
   the size over the columns/rows (based on the stretch factors).

   To remove a widget from a layout, call remove(). Calling
   QWidget::hide() on a widget also effectively removes the widget from
   the layout until QWidget::show() is called.

   This illustration shows a fragment of a dialog with a five-column,
   three-row grid (the grid is shown overlaid in magenta):

                               A grid layout

   Columns 0, 2 and 4 in this dialog fragment are made up of a QLabel, a
   QLineEdit, and a QListBox. Columns 1 and 3 are placeholders made with
   setColumnMinimumWidth(). Row 0 consists of three QLabel objects, row 1
   of three QLineEdit objects and row 2 of three QListBox objects. We
   used placeholder columns (1 and 3) to get the right amount of space
   between the columns.

   Note that the columns and rows are not equally wide or tall. If you
   want two columns to have the same width, you must set their minimum
   widths and stretch factors to be the same yourself. You do this using
   setColumnMinimumWidth() and setColumnStretch().

   If the QGridLayout is not the top-level layout (i.e. does not manage
   all of the widget's area and children), you must add it to its parent
   layout when you create it, but before you do anything with it. The
   normal way to add a layout is by calling addLayout() on the parent
   layout.

   Once you have added your layout you can start putting widgets and
   other layouts into the cells of your grid layout using addWidget(),
   addItem(), and addLayout().

   QGridLayout also includes two margin widths: the border and the
   spacing. The border is the width of the reserved space along each of
   the QGridLayout's four sides. The spacing is the width of the
   automatically allocated spacing between neighboring boxes.

   Both the border and the spacing are parameters of the constructor and
   default to 0.

Member Function Documentation

  QGridLayout::QGridLayout ( QWidget * parent )

   Constructs a new QGridLayout with parent widget, parent. The layout
   has one row and one column initially, and will expand when new items
   are inserted.

  QGridLayout::QGridLayout ()

   Constructs a new grid layout.

   You must insert this grid into another layout. You can insert widgets
   and layouts into this layout at any time, but laying out will not be
   performed before this is inserted into another layout.

  QGridLayout::~QGridLayout ()

   Destroys the grid layout. Geometry management is terminated if this is
   a top-level grid.

   The layout's widgets aren't destroyed.

  void QGridLayout::addItem ( QLayoutItem * item, int row, int column, int
  rowSpan = 1, int columnSpan = 1, Qt::Alignment alignment = 0 )

   Adds item at position row, column, spanning rowSpan rows and
   columnSpan columns, and aligns it according to alignment. If rowSpan
   and/or columnSpan is -1, then the item will extend to the bottom
   and/or right edge, respectively. The layout takes ownership of the
   item.

   Warning: Do not use this function to add child layouts or child widget
   items. Use addLayout() or addWidget() instead.

  void QGridLayout::addItem ( QLayoutItem * item )   [virtual protected]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Adds item to the next free position of this layout.

   Reimplemented from QLayout.

  void QGridLayout::addLayout ( QLayout * layout, int row, int column,
  Qt::Alignment alignment = 0 )

   Places the layout at position (row, column) in the grid. The top-left
   position is (0, 0).

   The alignment is specified by alignment. The default alignment is 0,
   which means that the widget fills the entire cell.

   A non-zero alignment indicates that the layout should not grow to fill
   the available space but should be sized according to sizeHint().

   layout becomes a child of the grid layout.

  void QGridLayout::addLayout ( QLayout * layout, int row, int column, int
  rowSpan, int columnSpan, Qt::Alignment alignment = 0 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version adds the layout layout to the cell grid, spanning
   multiple rows/columns. The cell will start at row, column spanning
   rowSpan rows and columnSpan columns.

   If rowSpan and/or columnSpan is -1, then the layout will extend to the
   bottom and/or right edge, respectively.

  void QGridLayout::addWidget ( QWidget * widget, int row, int column,
  Qt::Alignment alignment = 0 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Adds the given widget to the cell grid at row, column. The top-left
   position is (0, 0) by default.

   The alignment is specified by alignment. The default alignment is 0,
   which means that the widget fills the entire cell.

  void QGridLayout::addWidget ( QWidget * widget, int fromRow, int fromColumn,
  int rowSpan, int columnSpan, Qt::Alignment alignment = 0 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This version adds the given widget to the cell grid, spanning multiple
   rows/columns. The cell will start at fromRow, fromColumn spanning
   rowSpan rows and columnSpan columns. The grid will have the given
   alignment.

   If rowSpan and/or columnSpan is -1, then the widget will extend to the
   bottom and/or right edge, respectively.

  QRect QGridLayout::cellRect ( int row, int column ) const

   Returns the geometry of the cell with row row and column column in the
   grid. Returns an invalid rectangle if row or column is outside the
   grid.

   Warning: in the current version of Qt this function does not return
   valid results until setGeometry() has been called, i.e. after the
   parentWidget() is visible.

  int QGridLayout::columnCount () const

   Returns the number of columns in this grid.

  int QGridLayout::columnMinimumWidth ( int column ) const

   Returns the column spacing for column column.

   See also setColumnMinimumWidth().

  int QGridLayout::columnStretch ( int column ) const

   Returns the stretch factor for column column.

   See also setColumnStretch().

  Qt::Orientations QGridLayout::expandingDirections () const   [virtual]

   Returns whether this layout can make use of more space than
   sizeHint(). A value of Qt::Vertical or Qt::Horizontal means that it
   wants to grow in only one dimension, whereas BothDirections means that
   it wants to grow in both dimensions.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.

  void QGridLayout::getItemPosition ( int index, int * row, int * column, int *
  rowSpan, int * columnSpan )

   Returns the position information of the item with the given index.

   The variables passed as row and column are updated with the position
   of the item in the layout, and the rowSpan and columnSpan variables
   are updated with the vertical and horizontal spans of the item.

  bool QGridLayout::hasHeightForWidth () const   [virtual]

   Returns true if this layout's preferred height depends on its width;
   otherwise returns false.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.

  int QGridLayout::heightForWidth ( int w ) const   [virtual]

   Returns the layout's preferred height when it is w pixels wide.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.

  void QGridLayout::invalidate ()   [virtual]

   Resets cached information.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.

  QSize QGridLayout::maximumSize () const   [virtual]

   Returns the maximum size needed by this grid.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.

  QSize QGridLayout::minimumSize () const   [virtual]

   Returns the minimum size needed by this grid.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.

  Qt::Corner QGridLayout::originCorner () const

   Returns the corner that's used for the grid's origin, i.e. for
   position (0, 0).

  int QGridLayout::rowCount () const

   Returns the number of rows in this grid.

  int QGridLayout::rowMinimumHeight ( int row ) const

   Returns the minimum width set for row row.

   See also setRowMinimumHeight().

  int QGridLayout::rowStretch ( int row ) const

   Returns the stretch factor for row row.

   See also setRowStretch().

  void QGridLayout::setColumnMinimumWidth ( int column, int minSize )

   Sets the minimum width of column column to minSize pixels.

   See also columnMinimumWidth() and setRowMinimumHeight().

  void QGridLayout::setColumnStretch ( int column, int stretch )

   Sets the stretch factor of column column to stretch. The first column
   is number 0.

   The stretch factor is relative to the other columns in this grid.
   Columns with a higher stretch factor take more of the available space.

   The default stretch factor is 0. If the stretch factor is 0 and no
   other column in this table can grow at all, the column may still grow.

   An alternative approach is to add spacing using addItem() with a
   QSpacerItem.

   See also columnStretch() and setRowStretch().

  void QGridLayout::setGeometry ( const QRect & rect )   [virtual]

   Resizes managed widgets within the rectangle rect.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.

  void QGridLayout::setOriginCorner ( Qt::Corner corner )

   Sets the grid's origin corner, i.e. position (0, 0), to corner.

  void QGridLayout::setRowMinimumHeight ( int row, int minSize )

   Sets the minimum height of row row to minSize pixels.

   See also rowMinimumHeight() and setColumnMinimumWidth().

  void QGridLayout::setRowStretch ( int row, int stretch )

   Sets the stretch factor of row row to stretch. The first row is number
   0.

   The stretch factor is relative to the other rows in this grid. Rows
   with a higher stretch factor take more of the available space.

   The default stretch factor is 0. If the stretch factor is 0 and no
   other row in this table can grow at all, the row may still grow.

   See also rowStretch(), setRowMinimumHeight(), and setColumnStretch().

  QSize QGridLayout::sizeHint () const   [virtual]

   Returns the preferred size of this grid.

   Reimplemented from QLayoutItem.
