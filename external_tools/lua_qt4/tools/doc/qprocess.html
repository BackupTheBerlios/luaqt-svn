Detailed Description

   The QProcess class is used to start external programs and to
   communicate with them.

   To start a process, pass the name and command line arguments of the
   program you want to run as arguments to start(). QProcess then enters
   the Starting state, and when the program has started, QProcess enters
   the Running state and emits started().

   QProcess allows you to treat a process as a sequential I/O device. You
   can write to and read from the process just as you would access a
   network connection using QTcpSocket. You can then write to the
   process's standard input by calling write(), and read the standard
   output by calling read(), readLine(), and getChar(). Because it
   inherits QIODevice, QProcess can also be used as an input source for
   QXmlReader, or for generating data to be uploaded using QFtp.

   When the process exits, QProcess reenters the NotRunning state (the
   initial state), and emits finished().

   The finished() signal provides the exit code of the process as an
   argument, and you can also call exitCode() to obtain the exit code of
   the last process that finished. If an error occurs at any point in
   time, QProcess will emit the error() signal. You can also call error()
   to find the type of error that occurred last, and state() to find the
   current process state.

   Processes have two predefined output channels: The standard output
   channel (stdout) supplies regular console output, and the standard
   error channel (stderr) usually supplies the errors that are printed by
   the process. These channels represent two separate streams of data.
   You can toggle between them by calling setReadChannel(). QProcess
   emits readyRead() when data is available on the current read channel.
   It also emits readyReadStandardOutput() when new standard output data
   is available, and when new standard error data is available,
   readyReadStandardError() is emitted. Instead of calling read(),
   readLine(), or getChar(), you can explicitly read all data from either
   of the two channels by calling readAllStandardOutput() or
   readAllStandardError().

   The terminology for the channels can be misleading. Be aware that the
   process's output channels correspond to QProcess's read channels,
   whereas the process's input channels correspond to QProcess's write
   channels. This is because what we read using QProcess is the process's
   output, and what we write becomes the process's input.

   QProcess can merge the two output channels, so that standard output
   and standard error data from the running process both use the standard
   output channel. Call setReadChannelMode() with MergedChannels before
   starting the process to activative this feature. You also have the
   option of forwarding the output of the running process to the calling,
   main process, by passing ForwardedChannels as the argument.

   Certain processes need special environment settings in order to
   operate. You can set environment variables for your process by calling
   setEnvironment(). To set a working directory, call
   setWorkingDirectory(). By default, processes are run in the current
   working directory of the calling process.

   QProcess provides a set of functions which allow it to be used without
   an event loop, by suspending the calling thread until certain signals
   are emitted:
     * waitForStarted() blocks until the process has started.
     * waitForReadyRead() blocks until new data is available for reading
       on the current read channel.
     * waitForBytesWritten() blocks until one payload of data has been
       written to the process.
     * waitForFinished() blocks until the process has finished.

   Calling these functions from the main thread (the thread that calls
   QApplication::exec()) may cause your user interface to freeze.

   The following example runs gzip to compress the string "Qt rocks!",
   without an event loop:
        QProcess gzip;
        gzip.start("gzip", QStringList() << "-c");
        if (!gzip.waitForStarted())
            return false;

        gzip.write("Qt rocks!");
        gzip.closeWriteChannel();

        if (!gzip.waitForFinished())
            return false;

        QByteArray result = gzip.readAll();

   See also QBuffer, QFile, and QTcpSocket.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QProcess::ProcessChannel

   This enum describes the process channels used by the running process.
   Pass one of these values to setReadChannel() to set the current read
   channel of QProcess.

   Constant Value Description
   QProcess::StandardOutput 0 The standard output (stdout) of the running
   process.
   QProcess::StandardError 1 The standard error (stderr) of the running
   process.

   See also setReadChannel().

  enum QProcess::ProcessChannelMode

   This enum describes the process channel modes of QProcess. Pass one of
   these values to setReadChannelMode() to set the current read channel
   mode.

   Constant Value Description
   QProcess::SeparateChannels 0 QProcess manages the output of the
   running process, keeping standard output and standard error data in
   separate internal buffers. You can select the QProcess's current read
   channel by calling setReadChannel(). This is the default channel mode
   of QProcess.
   QProcess::MergedChannels 1 QProcess merges the output of the running
   process into the standard output channel (stdout). The standard error
   channel (stderr) will not receive any data. The standard output and
   standard error data of the running process are interleaved.
   QProcess::ForwardedChannels 2 QProcess forwards the output of the
   running process onto the main process. Anything the child process
   writes to its standard output and standard error will be written to
   the standard output and standard error of the main process.

   See also setReadChannelMode().

  enum QProcess::ProcessError

   This enum describes the different types of errors that are reported by
   QProcess.

   Constant Value Description
   QProcess::FailedToStart 0 The process failed to start. Either the
   invoked program is missing, or you may have insufficient permissions
   to invoke the program.
   QProcess::Crashed 1 The process crashed some time after starting
   successfully.
   QProcess::Timedout 2 The last waitFor...() function timed out. The
   state of QProcess is unchanged, and you can try calling waitFor...()
   again.
   QProcess::WriteError 4 An error occurred when attempting to write to
   the process. For example, the process may not be running, or it may
   have closed its input channel.
   QProcess::ReadError 3 An error occurred when attempting to read from
   the process. For example, the process may not be running.
   QProcess::UnknownError 5 An unknown error occurred. This is the
   default return value of error().

   See also error().

  enum QProcess::ProcessState

   This enum describes the different states of QProcess.

   Constant Value Description
   QProcess::NotRunning 0 The process is not running.
   QProcess::Starting 1 The process is starting, but the program has not
   yet been invoked.
   QProcess::Running 2 The process is running and is ready for reading
   and writing.

   See also state().

Member Function Documentation

  QProcess::QProcess ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QProcess object with the given parent.

  QProcess::~QProcess ()   [virtual]

   Destructs the QProcess object.

  void QProcess::close ()   [virtual]

   Closes all communication with the process. After calling this
   function, QProcess will no longer emit readyRead(), and data can no
   longer be read or written.

   Reimplemented from QIODevice.

  void QProcess::closeReadChannel ( ProcessChannel channel )

   Closes the read channel channel. After calling this function, QProcess
   will no longer receive data on the channel. Any data that has already
   been received is still available for reading.

   Call this function to save memory, if you are not interested in the
   output of the process.

   See also closeWriteChannel() and setReadChannel().

  void QProcess::closeWriteChannel ()

   Schedules the write channel of QProcess to be closed. The channel will
   close once all data has been written to the process. After calling
   this function, any attempts to write to the process will fail.

   Closing the write channel is necessary for programs that read input
   data until the channel has been closed. For example, the program
   "more" is used to display text data in a console on both Unix and
   Windows. But it will not display the text data until QProcess's write
   channel has been closed. Example:
    QProcess more;
    more.start("more");
    more.write("Text to display");
    more.closeWriteChannel();
    // QProcess will emit readyRead() once "more" starts printing

   The write channel is implicitly opened when start() is called.

   See also closeReadChannel().

  QStringList QProcess::environment () const

   Returns the environment that QProcess will use when starting a
   process, or an empty QStringList if no environment has been set. If no
   environment has been set, the environment of the calling process will
   be used.

   See also setEnvironment().

  QProcess::ProcessError QProcess::error () const

   Returns the type of error that occurred last.

   See also state().

  void QProcess::error ( ProcessError error )   [signal]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This signal is emitted when an error occurs with the process. The
   specified error describes the type of error that occurred.

  int QProcess::execute ( const QString & program, const QStringList &
  arguments )   [static]

   Starts the program program with the arguments arguments in a new
   process, waits for it to finish, and then returns the exit code of the
   process. Any data the new process writes to the console is forwarded
   to the calling process.

   The environment and working directory are inherited by the calling
   process.

  int QProcess::execute ( const QString & program )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Starts the program program in a new process. program is a single
   string of text containing both the program name and its arguments. The
   arguments are separated by one or more spaces.

  int QProcess::exitCode () const

   Returns the exit code of the last process that finished.

  void QProcess::finished ( int exitCode )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the process finishes. exitCode is the exit
   code of the process. After the process has finished, the buffers in
   QProcess are still intact. You can still read any data that the
   process may have written before it finished.

  void QProcess::kill ()   [slot]

   Kills the current process, causing it to exit immediately.

   On Windows, kill() uses TerminateProcess, and on Unix and Mac OS X,
   the SIGKILL signal is sent to the process.

   See also terminate().

  Q_PID QProcess::pid () const

   Returns the native process identifier for the running process, if
   available. If no process is currently running, 0 is returned.

  QByteArray QProcess::readAllStandardError ()

   Regardless of the current read channel, this function returns all data
   available from the standard error of the process as a QByteArray.

   See also readyReadStandardError(), readAllStandardOutput(),
   readChannel(), and setReadChannel().

  QByteArray QProcess::readAllStandardOutput ()

   Regardless of the current read channel, this function returns all data
   available from the standard output of the process as a QByteArray.

   See also readyReadStandardOutput(), readAllStandardError(),
   readChannel(), and setReadChannel().

  ProcessChannel QProcess::readChannel () const

   Returns the current read channel of the QProcess.

   See also setReadChannel().

  ProcessChannelMode QProcess::readChannelMode () const

   Returns the read channel mode of the QProcess.

   See also setReadChannelMode(), ProcessChannelMode, and
   setReadChannel().

  void QProcess::readyReadStandardError ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the process has made new data available
   through its standard error channel (stderr). It is emitted regardless
   of the current read channel.

   See also readAllStandardError() and readChannel().

  void QProcess::readyReadStandardOutput ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the process has made new data available
   through its standard output channel (stdout). It is emitted regardless
   of the current read channel.

   See also readAllStandardOutput() and readChannel().

  void QProcess::setEnvironment ( const QStringList & environment )

   Sets the environment that QProcess will use when starting a process to
   environment.

   See also environment().

  void QProcess::setProcessState ( ProcessState state )   [protected]

   Sets the current state of the QProcess to the state specified.

   See also state().

  void QProcess::setReadChannel ( ProcessChannel channel )

   Sets the current read channel of the QProcess to the given channel.
   The current input channel is used by the functions read(), readAll(),
   readLine(), and getChar(). It also determines which channel triggers
   QProcess to emit readyRead().

   See also readChannel().

  void QProcess::setReadChannelMode ( ProcessChannelMode mode )

   Sets the read channel mode of the QProcess to the mode specified. This
   mode will be used the next time start() is called. For example:
    QProcess builder;
    builder.setReadChannelMode(QProcess::MergedChannels);
    builder.start("make", QStringList() << "-j2");

    if (!builder.waitForFinished())
        qDebug() << "Make failed:" << builder.errorString();
    else
        qDebug() << "Make output:" << builder.readAll();

   See also readChannelMode(), ProcessChannelMode, and setReadChannel().

  void QProcess::setWorkingDirectory ( const QString & dir )

   Sets the working directory to dir. QProcess will start the process in
   this directory. The default behavior is to start the process in the
   working directory of the calling process.

   See also workingDirectory() and start().

  void QProcess::setupChildProcess ()   [virtual protected]

   This function is called in the child process context just before the
   program is executed on Unix or Mac OS X. Reimplement this function to
   do last minute initialization of the child process.

   Warning: This function is called by QProcess on Unix and Mac OS X
   only. On Windows, it is not called.

  void QProcess::start ( const QString & program, const QStringList &
  arguments, OpenMode mode = ReadWrite )

   Starts the program program in a new process, passing the command line
   arguments in arguments. The OpenMode is set to mode. QProcess will
   immediately enter the Starting state. If the process starts
   successfully, QProcess will emit started(); otherwise, error() will be
   emitted.

   See also pid() and started().

  void QProcess::start ( const QString & program, OpenMode mode = ReadWrite )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Starts the program program in a new process. program is a single
   string of text containing both the program name and its arguments. The
   arguments are separated by one or more spaces. For example:
    QProcess process;
    process.start("del /s *.txt");
    // same as process.start("del", QStringList() << "/s" << "*.txt");
    ...

   The program string can also contain quotes, to ensure that arguments
   containing spaces are correctly supplied to the new process. For
   example:
    QProcess process;
    process.start("dir \"My Documents\"");

   The OpenMode is set to mode.

  bool QProcess::startDetached ( const QString & program, const QStringList &
  arguments )   [static]

   Starts the program program with the arguments arguments in a new
   process, and detaches from it. Returns true on success; otherwise
   returns false. If the calling process exits, the detached process will
   continue to live.

   On Unix, the started process will run in its own session and act like
   a daemon. On Windows, it will run as a regular standalone process.

  bool QProcess::startDetached ( const QString & program )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Starts the program program in a new process. program is a single
   string of text containing both the program name and its arguments. The
   arguments are separated by one or more spaces.

   The program string can also contain quotes, to ensure that arguments
   containing spaces are correctly supplied to the new process.

  void QProcess::started ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted by QProcess when the process has started, and
   state() returns Running.

  QProcess::ProcessState QProcess::state () const

   Returns the current state of the process.

   See also stateChanged() and error().

  void QProcess::stateChanged ( ProcessState newState )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted whenever the state of QProcess changes. The
   newState argument is the state QProcess changed to.

  void QProcess::terminate ()   [slot]

   Attempts to terminate the process.

   The process may not exit as a result of calling this function (it is
   given the chance to prompt the user for any unsaved files, etc).

   On Windows, terminate() posts a WM_CLOSE message to the process, and
   on Unix and Mac OS X the SIGTERM signal is sent.

   See also kill().

  bool QProcess::waitForFinished ( int msecs = 30000 )

   Blocks until the process has finished and the finished() signal has
   been emitted, or until msecs milliseconds have passed.

   Returns true if the process finished; otherwise returns false (if the
   operation timed out or if an error occurred).

   This function can operate without an event loop. It is useful when
   writing non-GUI applications and when performing I/O operations in a
   non-GUI thread.

   Warning: Calling this function from the main (GUI) thread might cause
   your user interface to freeze.

   If msecs is -1, this function will not time out.

   See also finished(), waitForStarted(), waitForReadyRead(), and
   waitForBytesWritten().

  bool QProcess::waitForStarted ( int msecs = 30000 )

   Blocks until the process has started and the started() signal has been
   emitted, or until msecs milliseconds have passed.

   Returns true if the process was started successfully; otherwise
   returns false (if the operation timed out or if an error occurred).

   This function can operate without an event loop. It is useful when
   writing non-GUI applications and when performing I/O operations in a
   non-GUI thread.

   Warning: Calling this function from the main (GUI) thread might cause
   your user interface to freeze.

   If msecs is -1, this function will not time out.

   See also started(), waitForReadyRead(), waitForBytesWritten(), and
   waitForFinished().

  QString QProcess::workingDirectory () const

   Returns the working directory that the QProcess will enter before the
   program has started.

   See also setWorkingDirectory().
