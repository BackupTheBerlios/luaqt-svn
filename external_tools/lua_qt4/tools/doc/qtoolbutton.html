Detailed Description

   The QToolButton class provides a quick-access button to commands or
   options, usually used inside a QToolBar.

   A tool button is a special button that provides quick-access to
   specific commands or options. As opposed to a normal command button, a
   tool button usually doesn't show a text label, but shows an icon
   instead. Its classic usage is to select tools, for example the "pen"
   tool in a drawing program. This would be implemented with a
   QToolButton as toggle button (see setToggleButton()).

   QToolButton supports auto-raising. In auto-raise mode, the button
   draws a 3D frame only when the mouse points at it. The feature is
   automatically turned on when a button is used inside a QToolBar.
   Change it with setAutoRaise().

   A tool button's icon is set as QIcon. This makes it possible to
   specify different pixmaps for the disabled and active state. The
   disabled pixmap is used when the button's functionality is not
   available. The active pixmap is displayed when the button is
   auto-raised because the mouse pointer is hovering over it.

   The button's look and dimension is adjustable with
   setToolButtonStyle() and setIconSize(). When used inside a QToolBar in
   a QMainWindow, the button automatically adjusts to QMainWindow's
   settings (see QMainWindow::setToolButtonStyle() and
   QMainWindow::setIconSize()). Instead of an icon, a tool button can
   also display an arrow symbol, specified with arrowType.

   A tool button can offer additional choices in a popup menu. The popup
   menu can be set using setMenu(). Use setPopupMode() to configure the
   different modes available for tool buttons with a menu set. The
   default mode is DelayedPopupMode which is sometimes used with the
   "Back" button in a web browser. After pressing and holding the button
   down for a while, a menu pops up showing a list of possible pages to
   jump to. The default delay is 600ms; you can adjust it with
   setPopupDelay().

Member Type Documentation

  enum QToolButton::ToolButtonPopupMode

   Describes how a menu should be popped up for tool buttons that has a
   menu set or contains a list of actions.

   Constant Value Description
   QToolButton::DelayedPopup 0 After pressing and holding the tool button
   down for a certain amount of time (the timeout is style dependant, see
   QStyle::SH_ToolButton_PopupDelay), the menu is displayed. A typical
   application example is the "back" button in some web browsers's tool
   bars. If the user clicks it, the browser simply browses back to the
   previous page. If the user presses and holds the button down for a
   while, the tool button shows a menu containing the current history
   list
   QToolButton::MenuButtonPopup 1 In this mode the tool button displays a
   special arrow to indicate that a menu is present. The menu is
   displayed when the arrow part of the button is pressed.
   QToolButton::InstantPopup 2 The menu is displayed, without delay, when
   the tool button is pressed. In this mode, the button's own action is
   not triggered.

Property Documentation

  arrowType : Qt::ArrowType

   This property holds whether the button displays an arrow instead of a
   normal icon.

   This displays an arrow as the icon for the QToolButton.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::ArrowType arrowType () const
     * void setArrowType ( Qt::ArrowType type )

  autoRaise : bool

   This property holds whether auto-raising is enabled or not.

   The default is disabled (i.e. false).

   Access functions:
     * bool autoRaise () const
     * void setAutoRaise ( bool enable )

  popupMode : ToolButtonPopupMode

   This property holds describes the way that popup menus are used with
   tool buttons.

   Access functions:
     * ToolButtonPopupMode popupMode () const
     * void setPopupMode ( ToolButtonPopupMode mode )

  toolButtonStyle : Qt::ToolButtonStyle

   This property holds whether the tool button displays an icon only,
   text only, or text beside/below the icon.

   The default is Qt::ToolButtonIconOnly.

   QToolButton automatically connects this slot to the relevant signal in
   the QMainWindow in which is resides.

   Access functions:
     * Qt::ToolButtonStyle toolButtonStyle () const
     * void setToolButtonStyle ( Qt::ToolButtonStyle style )

Member Function Documentation

  QToolButton::QToolButton ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs an empty tool button with parent parent.

  QToolButton::~QToolButton ()

   Destroys the object and frees any allocated resources.

  QAction * QToolButton::defaultAction () const

   Returns the default action.

   See also setDefaultAction().

  QMenu * QToolButton::menu () const

   Returns the associated menu, or 0 if no menu has been defined.

   See also setMenu().

  void QToolButton::paintEvent ( QPaintEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   Paints the button in response to the paint event.

   Reimplemented from QWidget.

  void QToolButton::setDefaultAction ( QAction * action )   [slot]

   Sets the default action to action.

   If a tool button has a default action, the action defines the button's
   properties like text, icon, tool tip, etc.

  void QToolButton::setMenu ( QMenu * menu )

   Associates the given menu with this tool button.

   The menu will be shown according to the button's popupMode. .

   Ownership of the menu is not transferred to the tool button.

   See also menu().

  void QToolButton::showMenu ()   [slot]

   Shows (pops up) the associated popup menu. If there is no such menu,
   this function does nothing. This function does not return until the
   popup menu has been closed by the user.

  void QToolButton::triggered ( QAction * action )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the given action is triggered.

   The action may also be associated with other parts of the user
   interface, such as menu items and keyboard shortcuts. Sharing actions
   in this way helps make the user interface more consistent and is often
   less work to implement.
