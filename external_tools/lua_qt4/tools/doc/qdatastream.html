Detailed Description

   The QDataStream class provides serialization of binary data to a
   QIODevice.

   A data stream is a binary stream of encoded information which is 100%
   independent of the host computer's operating system, CPU or byte
   order. For example, a data stream that is written by a PC under
   Windows can be read by a Sun SPARC running Solaris.

   You can also use a data stream to read/write raw unencoded binary
   data. If you want a "parsing" input stream, see QTextStream.

   The QDataStream class implements the serialization of C++'s basic data
   types, like char, short, int, char *, etc. Serialization of more
   complex data is accomplished by breaking up the data into primitive
   units.

   A data stream cooperates closely with a QIODevice. A QIODevice
   represents an input/output medium one can read data from and write
   data to. The QFile class is an example of an I/O device.

   Example (write binary data to a stream):
    QFile file("file.dat");
    file.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly);
    QDataStream out(&file);   // we will serialize the data into the file
    out << "the answer is";   // serialize a string
    out << (qint32)42;        // serialize an integer

   Example (read binary data from a stream):
    QFile file("file.dat");
    file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
    QDataStream in(&file);    // read the data serialized from the file
    QString str;
    qint32 a;
    in >> str >> a;           // extract "the answer is" and 42

   Each item written to the stream is written in a predefined binary
   format that varies depending on the item's type. Supported Qt types
   include QBrush, QColor, QDateTime, QFont, QPixmap, QString, QVariant
   and many others. For the complete list of all Qt types supporting data
   streaming see the Format of the QDataStream operators.

   For integers it is best to always cast to a Qt integer type for
   writing, and to read back into the same Qt integer type. This ensures
   that you get integers of the size you want and insulates you from
   compiler and platform differences.

   To take one example, a char * string is written as a 32-bit integer
   equal to the length of the string including the '\0' byte, followed by
   all the characters of the string including the '\0' byte. When reading
   a char * string, 4 bytes are read to create the 32-bit length value,
   then that many characters for the char * string including the '\0'
   terminator are read.

   The initial I/O device is usually set in the constructor, but can be
   changed with setDevice(). If you've reached the end of the data (or if
   there is no I/O device set) atEnd() will return true.

  Versioning

   QDataStream's binary format has evolved since Qt 1.0, and is likely to
   continue evolving to reflect changes done in Qt. When inputting or
   outputting complex types, it's very important to make sure that the
   same version of the stream (version()) is used for reading and
   writing. If you need both forward and backward compatibility, you can
   hardcode the version number in the application:
    stream.setVersion(QDataStream::Qt_4_0);

   If you are producing a new binary data format, such as a file format
   for documents created by your application, you could use a QDataStream
   to write the data in a portable format. Typically, you would write a
   brief header containing a magic string and a version number to give
   yourself room for future expansion. For example:
    QFile file("file.xxx");
    file.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly);
    QDataStream out(&file);

    // Write a header with a "magic number" and a version
    out << (quint32)0xA0B0C0D0;
    out << (qint32)123;

    out.setVersion(QDataStream::Qt_4_0);

    // Write the data
    out << lots_of_interesting_data;

   Then read it in with:
    QFile file("file.xxx");
    file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);
    QDataStream in(&file);

    // Read and check the header
    quint32 magic;
    in >> magic;
    if (magic != 0xA0B0C0D0)
        return XXX_BAD_FILE_FORMAT;

    // Read the version
    qint32 version;
    in >> version;
    if (version < 100)
        return XXX_BAD_FILE_TOO_OLD;
    if (version > 123)
        return XXX_BAD_FILE_TOO_NEW;

    if (version <= 110)
        in.setVersion(QDataStream::Qt_3_2);
    else
        in.setVersion(QDataStream::Qt_4_0);

    // Read the data
    in >> lots_of_interesting_data;
    if (version >= 120)
        in >> data_new_in_XXX_version_1_2;
    in >> other_interesting_data;

   You can select which byte order to use when serializing data. The
   default setting is big endian (MSB first). Changing it to little
   endian breaks the portability (unless the reader also changes to
   little endian). We recommend keeping this setting unless you have
   special requirements.

  Reading and writing raw binary data

   You may wish to read/write your own raw binary data to/from the data
   stream directly. Data may be read from the stream into a preallocated
   char * using readRawData(). Similarly data can be written to the
   stream using writeRawData(). Note that any encoding/decoding of the
   data must be done by you.

   A similar pair of functions is readBytes() and writeBytes(). These
   differ from their raw counterparts as follows: readBytes() reads a
   quint32 which is taken to be the length of the data to be read, then
   that number of bytes is read into the preallocated char *;
   writeBytes() writes a quint32 containing the length of the data,
   followed by the data. Note that any encoding/decoding of the data
   (apart from the length quint32) must be done by you.

   See also QTextStream and QVariant.

Member Function Documentation

  QDataStream::QDataStream ()

   Constructs a data stream that has no I/O device.

   See also setDevice().

  QDataStream::QDataStream ( QIODevice * d )

   Constructs a data stream that uses the I/O device d.

   Warning: If you use QSocket or QSocketDevice as the I/O device d for
   reading data, you must make sure that enough data is available on the
   socket for the operation to successfully proceed; QDataStream does not
   have any means to handle or recover from short-reads.

   See also setDevice() and device().

  QDataStream::QDataStream ( QByteArray * a, QIODevice::OpenMode mode )

   Constructs a data stream that operates on a byte array, a. The mode
   describes how the device is to be used.

   Alternatively, you can use QDataStream(const QByteArray &) if you just
   want to read from a byte array.

   Since QByteArray is not a QIODevice subclass, internally a QBuffer is
   created to wrap the byte array.

  QDataStream::QDataStream ( const QByteArray & a )

   Constructs a read-only data stream that operates on byte array a. Use
   QDataStream(QByteArray*, int) if you want to write to a byte array.

   Since QByteArray is not a QIODevice subclass, internally a QBuffer is
   created to wrap the byte array.

  QDataStream::~QDataStream ()   [virtual]

   Destroys the data stream.

   The destructor will not affect the current I/O device, unless it is an
   internal I/O device (e.g. a QBuffer) processing a QByteArray passed in
   the constructor, in which case the internal I/O device is destroyed.

  bool QDataStream::atEnd () const

   Returns true if the I/O device has reached the end position (end of
   the stream or file) or if there is no I/O device set; otherwise
   returns false.

   See also QIODevice::atEnd().

  ByteOrder QDataStream::byteOrder () const

   Returns the current byte order setting -- either BigEndian or
   LittleEndian.

   See also setByteOrder().

  QIODevice * QDataStream::device () const

   Returns the I/O device currently set.

   See also setDevice() and unsetDevice().

  QDataStream & QDataStream::readBytes ( char *& s, uint & l )

   Reads the buffer s from the stream and returns a reference to the
   stream.

   The buffer s is allocated using new. Destroy it with the delete[]
   operator.

   The l parameter is set to the length of the buffer. If the string read
   is empty, l is set to 0 and s is set to a null pointer.

   The serialization format is a quint32 length specifier first, then l
   bytes of data.

   See also readRawData() and writeBytes().

  int QDataStream::readRawData ( char * s, int len )

   Reads len bytes from the stream into s and returns a reference to the
   stream.

   The buffer s must be preallocated. The data is not encoded.

   See also readBytes(), QIODevice::read(), and writeRawData().

  void QDataStream::resetStatus ()

   Resets the status of the data stream.

   See also Status, status(), and setStatus().

  void QDataStream::setByteOrder ( ByteOrder bo )

   Sets the serialization byte order to bo.

   The bo parameter can be QDataStream::BigEndian or
   QDataStream::LittleEndian.

   The default setting is big endian. We recommend leaving this setting
   unless you have special requirements.

   See also byteOrder().

  void QDataStream::setDevice ( QIODevice * d )

   void QDataStream::setDevice(QIODevice *d)

   Sets the I/O device to d.

   See also device() and unsetDevice().

  void QDataStream::setStatus ( Status status )

   Sets the status of the data stream to the status given.

   See also Status, status(), and resetStatus().

  void QDataStream::setVersion ( int v )

   Sets the version number of the data serialization format to v.

   You don't have to set a version if you are using the current version
   of Qt, but for your own custom binary formats we recommend that you
   do; see Versioning in the Detailed Description.

   In order to accommodate new functionality, the datastream
   serialization format of some Qt classes has changed in some versions
   of Qt. If you want to read data that was created by an earlier version
   of Qt, or write data that can be read by a program that was compiled
   with an earlier version of Qt, use this function to modify the
   serialization format used by QDataStream.

                       Qt Version    QDataStream Version
                         Qt 4.0               7
                         Qt 3.3               6
                      Qt 3.1, 3.2             5
                         Qt 3.0               4
                    Qt 2.1, 2.2, 2.3          3

                         Qt 1.x               1

   The Version enum provides symbolic constants for the different
   versions of Qt. For example:
    QDataStream out(file);
    out.setVersion(QDataStream::Qt_4_0);

   See also version() and Version.

  Status QDataStream::status () const

   Returns the status of the data stream.

   See also Status, setStatus(), and resetStatus().

  void QDataStream::unsetDevice ()

   Unsets the I/O device. This is the same as calling setDevice(0).

   See also device() and setDevice().

  int QDataStream::version () const

   Returns the version number of the data serialization format.

   See also setVersion() and Version.

  QDataStream & QDataStream::writeBytes ( const char * s, uint len )

   that the data is not encoded.

   See also writeRawData() and readBytes().

  int QDataStream::writeRawData ( const char * s, int len )
