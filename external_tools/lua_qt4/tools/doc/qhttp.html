Detailed Description

   The QHttp class provides an implementation of the HTTP protocol.

   This class provides a direct interface to HTTP that allows you to have
   more control over the requests and that allows you to access the
   response header fields.

   The class works asynchronously, so there are no blocking functions. If
   an operation cannot be executed immediately, the function will still
   return straight away and the operation will be scheduled for later
   execution. The results of scheduled operations are reported via
   signals. This approach depends on the event loop being in operation.

   The operations that can be scheduled (they are called "requests" in
   the rest of the documentation) are the following: setHost(), get(),
   post(), head() and request().

   All of these requests return a unique identifier that allows you to
   keep track of the request that is currently executed. When the
   execution of a request starts, the requestStarted() signal with the
   identifier is emitted and when the request is finished, the
   requestFinished() signal is emitted with the identifier and a bool
   that indicates if the request finished with an error.

   To make an HTTP request you must set up suitable HTTP headers. The
   following example demonstrates, how to request the main HTML page from
   the Trolltech home page (i.e. the URL
   http://www.trolltech.com/index.html):
    QHttpRequestHeader header("GET", "/index.html");
    header.setValue("Host", "www.trolltech.com");
    http->setHost("www.trolltech.com");
    http->request(header);

   For the common HTTP requests GET, POST and HEAD, QHttp provides the
   convenience functions get(), post() and head(). They already use a
   reasonable header and if you don't have to set special header fields,
   they are easier to use. The above example can also be written as:
    http->setHost("www.trolltech.com"); // id == 1
    http->get("/index.html");           // id == 2

   For this example the following sequence of signals is emitted (with
   small variations, depending on network traffic, etc.):
    requestStarted(1)
    requestFinished(1, false)

    requestStarted(2)
    stateChanged(Connecting)
    stateChanged(Sending)
    dataSendProgress(77, 77)
    stateChanged(Reading)
    responseHeaderReceived(responseheader)
    dataReadProgress(5388, 0)
    readyRead(responseheader)
    dataReadProgress(18300, 0)
    readyRead(responseheader)
    stateChanged(Connected)
    requestFinished(2, false)

    done(false)

    stateChanged(Closing)
    stateChanged(Unconnected)

   The dataSendProgress() and dataReadProgress() signals in the above
   example are useful if you want to show a progressbar to inform the
   user about the progress of the download. The second argument is the
   total size of data. In certain cases it is not possible to know the
   total amount in advance, in which case the second argument is 0. (If
   you connect to a QProgressBar a total of 0 results in a busy
   indicator.)

   When the response header is read, it is reported with the
   responseHeaderReceived() signal.

   The readyRead() signal tells you that there is data ready to be read.
   The amount of data can then be queried with the bytesAvailable()
   function and it can be read with the read() or readAll() functions.

   If an error occurs during the execution of one of the commands in a
   sequence of commands, all the pending commands (i.e. scheduled, but
   not yet executed commands) are cleared and no signals are emitted for
   them.

   For example, if you have the following sequence of requests
    http->setHost("www.foo.bar");       // id == 1
    http->get("/index.html");           // id == 2
    http->post("register.html", data);  // id == 3

   and the get() request fails because the host lookup fails, then the
   post() request is never executed and the signals would look like this:
    requestStarted(1)
    requestFinished(1, false)

    requestStarted(2)
    stateChanged(HostLookup)
    requestFinished(2, true)

    done(true)

    stateChanged(Unconnected)

   You can then get details about the error with the error() and
   errorString() functions. Note that only unexpected behavior, like
   network failure is considered as an error. If the server response
   contains an error status, like a 404 response, this is reported as a
   normal response case. So you should always check the status code of
   the response header.

   The functions currentId() and currentRequest() provide more
   information about the currently executing request.

   The functions hasPendingRequests() and clearPendingRequests() allow
   you to query and clear the list of pending requests.

   The HTTP example illustrates how to write HTTP clients using QHttp.

Member Function Documentation

  QHttp::QHttp ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QHttp object. The parent parameter is passed on to the
   QObject constructor.

  QHttp::QHttp ( const QString & hostName, quint16 port = 80, QObject * parent
  = 0 )

   Constructs a QHttp object. Subsequent requests are done by connecting
   to the server hostName on port port.

   The parent parameter is passed on to the QObject constructor.

   See also setHost().

  QHttp::~QHttp ()   [virtual]

   Destroys the QHttp object. If there is an open connection, it is
   closed.

  void QHttp::abort ()   [slot]

   Aborts the current request and deletes all scheduled requests.

   For the current request, the requestFinished() signal with the error
   argument true is emitted. For all other requests that are affected by
   the abort(), no signals are emitted.

   Since this slot also deletes the scheduled requests, there are no
   requests left and the done() signal is emitted (with the error
   argument true).

   See also clearPendingRequests().

  qint64 QHttp::bytesAvailable () const

   Returns the number of bytes that can be read from the response content
   at the moment.

   See also get(), post(), request(), readyRead(), read(), and readAll().

  void QHttp::clearPendingRequests ()

   Deletes all pending requests from the list of scheduled requests. This
   does not affect the request that is being executed. If you want to
   stop this this as well, use abort().

   See also hasPendingRequests() and abort().

  int QHttp::close ()

   Closes the connection; this is useful if you have a keep-alive
   connection and want to close it.

   For the requests issued with get(), post() and head(), QHttp sets the
   connection to be keep-alive. You can also do this using the header you
   pass to the request() function. QHttp only closes the connection to
   the HTTP server if the response header requires it to do so.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

   If you want to close the connection immediately, you have to use
   abort() instead.

   See also stateChanged(), abort(), requestStarted(), requestFinished(),
   and done().

  QIODevice * QHttp::currentDestinationDevice () const

   Returns the QIODevice pointer that is used as to store the data of the
   HTTP request being executed. If there is no current request or if the
   request does not store the data to an IO device, this function returns
   0.

   This function can be used to delete the QIODevice in the slot
   connected to the requestFinished() signal.

   See also currentSourceDevice(), get(), post(), and request().

  int QHttp::currentId () const

   Returns the identifier of the HTTP request being executed or 0 if
   there is no request being executed (i.e. they've all finished).

   See also currentRequest().

  QHttpRequestHeader QHttp::currentRequest () const

   Returns the request header of the HTTP request being executed. If the
   request is one issued by setHost() or close(), it returns an invalid
   request header, i.e. QHttpRequestHeader::isValid() returns false.

   See also currentId().

  QIODevice * QHttp::currentSourceDevice () const

   Returns the QIODevice pointer that is used as the data source of the
   HTTP request being executed. If there is no current request or if the
   request does not use an IO device as the data source, this function
   returns 0.

   This function can be used to delete the QIODevice in the slot
   connected to the requestFinished() signal.

   See also currentDestinationDevice(), post(), and request().

  void QHttp::dataReadProgress ( int done, int total )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when this object reads data from a HTTP server
   to indicate the current progress of the download.

   done is the amount of data that has already arrived and total is the
   total amount of data. It is possible that the total amount of data
   that should be transferred cannot be determined, in which case total
   is 0.(If you connect to a QProgressBar, the progress bar shows a busy
   indicator if the total is 0).

   Warning: done and total are not necessarily the size in bytes, since
   for large files these values might need to be "scaled" to avoid
   overflow.

   See also dataSendProgress(), get(), post(), request(), and
   QProgressBar.

  void QHttp::dataSendProgress ( int done, int total )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when this object sends data to a HTTP server to
   inform it about the progress of the upload.

   done is the amount of data that has already arrived and total is the
   total amount of data. It is possible that the total amount of data
   that should be transferred cannot be determined, in which case total
   is 0.(If you connect to a QProgressBar, the progress bar shows a busy
   indicator if the total is 0).

   Warning: done and total are not necessarily the size in bytes, since
   for large files these values might need to be "scaled" to avoid
   overflow.

   See also dataReadProgress(), post(), request(), and QProgressBar.

  void QHttp::done ( bool error )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the last pending request has finished; (it
   is emitted after the last request's requestFinished() signal). error
   is true if an error occurred during the processing; otherwise error is
   false.

   See also requestFinished(), error(), and errorString().

  Error QHttp::error () const

   Returns the last error that occurred. This is useful to find out what
   happened when receiving a requestFinished() or a done() signal with
   the error argument true.

   If you start a new request, the error status is reset to NoError.

  QString QHttp::errorString () const

   Returns a human-readable description of the last error that occurred.
   This is useful to present a error message to the user when receiving a
   requestFinished() or a done() signal with the error argument true.

  int QHttp::get ( const QString & path, QIODevice * to = 0 )

   Sends a get request for path to the server set by setHost() or as
   specified in the constructor.

   path must be an absolute path like /index.html or an absolute URI like
   http://www.trolltech.com/index.html.

   If the IO device to is 0 the readyRead() signal is emitted every time
   new content data is available to read.

   If the IO device to is not 0, the content data of the response is
   written directly to the device. Make sure that the to pointer is valid
   for the duration of the operation (it is safe to delete it when the
   requestFinished() signal is emitted).

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also setHost(), post(), head(), request(), requestStarted(),
   requestFinished(), and done().

  bool QHttp::hasPendingRequests () const

   Returns true if there are any requests scheduled that have not yet
   been executed; otherwise returns false.

   The request that is being executed is not considered as a scheduled
   request.

   See also clearPendingRequests(), currentId(), and currentRequest().

  int QHttp::head ( const QString & path )

   Sends a header request for path to the server set by setHost() or as
   specified in the constructor.

   path must be an absolute path like /index.html or an absolute URI like
   http://www.trolltech.com/index.html.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also setHost(), get(), post(), request(), requestStarted(),
   requestFinished(), and done().

  QHttpResponseHeader QHttp::lastResponse () const

   Returns the received response header of the most recently finished
   HTTP request. If no response has yet been received
   QHttpResponseHeader::isValid() will return false.

   See also currentRequest().

  int QHttp::post ( const QString & path, QIODevice * data, QIODevice * to = 0
  )

   Sends a post request for path to the server set by setHost() or as
   specified in the constructor.

   path must be an absolute path like /index.html or an absolute URI like
   http://www.trolltech.com/index.html.

   The incoming data comes via the data IO device.

   If the IO device to is 0 the readyRead() signal is emitted every time
   new content data is available to read.

   If the IO device to is not 0, the content data of the response is
   written directly to the device. Make sure that the to pointer is valid
   for the duration of the operation (it is safe to delete it when the
   requestFinished() signal is emitted).

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also setHost(), get(), head(), request(), requestStarted(),
   requestFinished(), and done().

  int QHttp::post ( const QString & path, const QByteArray & data, QIODevice *
  to = 0 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   data is used as the content data of the HTTP request.

  qint64 QHttp::read ( char * data, qint64 maxlen )

   Reads maxlen bytes from the response content into data and returns the
   number of bytes read. Returns -1 if an error occurred.

   See also get(), post(), request(), readyRead(), bytesAvailable(), and
   readAll().

  QByteArray QHttp::readAll ()

   Reads all the bytes from the response content and returns them.

   See also get(), post(), request(), readyRead(), bytesAvailable(), and
   read().

  void QHttp::readyRead ( const QHttpResponseHeader & resp )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when there is new response data to read.

   If you specified a device in the request where the data should be
   written to, then this signal is not emitted; instead the data is
   written directly to the device.

   The response header is passed in resp.

   You can read the data with the readAll() or read() functions

   This signal is useful if you want to process the data in chunks as
   soon as it becomes available. If you are only interested in the
   complete data, just connect to the requestFinished() signal and read
   the data then instead.

   See also get(), post(), request(), readAll(), read(), and
   bytesAvailable().

  int QHttp::request ( const QHttpRequestHeader & header, QIODevice * data = 0,
  QIODevice * to = 0 )

   Sends a request to the server set by setHost() or as specified in the
   constructor. Uses the header as the HTTP request header. You are
   responsible for setting up a header that is appropriate for your
   request.

   The incoming data comes via the data IO device.

   If the IO device to is 0 the readyRead() signal is emitted every time
   new content data is available to read.

   If the IO device to is not 0, the content data of the response is
   written directly to the device. Make sure that the to pointer is valid
   for the duration of the operation (it is safe to delete it when the
   requestFinished() signal is emitted).

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also setHost(), get(), post(), head(), requestStarted(),
   requestFinished(), and done().

  int QHttp::request ( const QHttpRequestHeader & header, const QByteArray &
  data, QIODevice * to = 0 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   data is used as the content data of the HTTP request.

  void QHttp::requestFinished ( int id, bool error )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when processing the request identified by id
   has finished. error is true if an error occurred during the
   processing; otherwise error is false.

   See also requestStarted(), done(), error(), and errorString().

  void QHttp::requestStarted ( int id )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when processing the request identified by id
   starts.

   See also requestFinished() and done().

  void QHttp::responseHeaderReceived ( const QHttpResponseHeader & resp )
  [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the HTTP header of a server response is
   available. The header is passed in resp.

   See also get(), post(), head(), request(), and readyRead().

  int QHttp::setHost ( const QString & hostName, quint16 port = 80 )

   Sets the HTTP server that is used for requests to hostName on port
   port.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also get(), post(), head(), request(), requestStarted(),
   requestFinished(), and done().

  int QHttp::setProxy ( const QString & host, int port, const QString &
  username = QString(), const QString & password = QString() )

   Enables proxy support, using the proxy server host on port port.
   username and password can be provided if the proxy server requires
   authentication.

  int QHttp::setSocket ( QTcpSocket * socket )

   Replaces the internal QSocket that QHttp uses with the given socket.
   This is useful if you want to use your own custom QSocket subclass
   instead of the plain QSocket that QHttp uses by default.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

  int QHttp::setUser ( const QString & userName, const QString & password =
  QString() )

   This function sets the user name userName and password password for
   web pages that require authentication.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The request is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by requestStarted() and
   requestFinished().

   When the request is started the requestStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the requestFinished() signal is emitted.

  State QHttp::state () const

   Returns the current state of the object. When the state changes, the
   stateChanged() signal is emitted.

   See also State and stateChanged().

  void QHttp::stateChanged ( int state )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the state of the QHttp object changes. The
   argument state is the new state of the connection; it is one of the
   State values.

   This usually happens when a request is started, but it can also happen
   when the server closes the connection or when a call to close()
   succeeded.

   See also get(), post(), head(), request(), close(), state(), and
   State.
