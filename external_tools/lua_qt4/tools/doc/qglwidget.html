Detailed Description

   The QGLWidget class is a widget for rendering OpenGL graphics.

   QGLWidget provides functionality for displaying OpenGL
   graphics integrated into a Qt application. It is very simple to use.
   You inherit from it and use the subclass like any other QWidget,
   except that instead of drawing the widget's contents using QPainter
   etc. you use the standard OpenGL rendering commands.

   QGLWidget provides three convenient virtual functions that you can
   reimplement in your subclass to perform the typical OpenGL tasks:
     * paintGL() - Renders the OpenGL scene. Gets called whenever the
       widget needs to be updated.
     * resizeGL() - Sets up the OpenGL viewport, projection, etc. Gets
       called whenever the the widget has been resized (and also when it
       is shown for the first time because all newly created widgets get
       a resize event automatically).
     * initializeGL() - Sets up the OpenGL rendering context, defines
       display lists, etc. Gets called once before the first time
       resizeGL() or paintGL() is called.

   Here is a rough outline of how a QGLWidget subclass might look:
    class MyGLDrawer : public QGLWidget
    {
        Q_OBJECT        // must include this if you use Qt signals/slots

    public:
        MyGLDrawer(QWidget *parent)
            : QGLWidget(parent) {}

    protected:

        void initializeGL()
        {
            // Set up the rendering context, define display lists etc.:
            ...
            glClearColor(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
            glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
            ...
        }

        void resizeGL(int w, int h)
        {
            // setup viewport, projection etc.:
            glViewport(0, 0, (GLint)w, (GLint)h);
            ...
            glFrustum(...);
            ...
        }

        void paintGL()
        {
            // draw the scene:
            ...
            glRotatef(...);
            glMaterialfv(...);
            glBegin(GL_QUADS);
            glVertex3f(...);
            glVertex3f(...);
            ...
            glEnd();
            ...
        }

    };

   If you need to trigger a repaint from places other than paintGL() (a
   typical example is when using timers to animate scenes), you should
   call the widget's updateGL() function.

   Your widget's OpenGL rendering context is made current when paintGL(),
   resizeGL(), or initializeGL() is called. If you need to call the
   standard OpenGL API functions from other places (e.g. in your widget's
   constructor or in your own paint functions), you must call
   makeCurrent() first.

   QGLWidget provides functions for requesting a new display format and
   you can also create widgets with customized rendering contexts.

   You can also share OpenGL display lists between QGLWidgets (see the
   documentation of the QGLWidget constructors for details).

  Overlays

   The QGLWidget creates a GL overlay context in addition to the normal
   context if overlays are supported by the underlying system.

   If you want to use overlays, you specify it in the format. (Note:
   Overlay must be requested in the format passed to the QGLWidget
   constructor.) Your GL widget should also implement some or all of
   these virtual methods:
     * paintOverlayGL()
     * resizeOverlayGL()
     * initializeOverlayGL()

   These methods work in the same way as the normal paintGL() etc.
   functions, except that they will be called when the overlay context is
   made current. You can explicitly make the overlay context current by
   using makeOverlayCurrent(), and you can access the overlay context
   directly (e.g. to ask for its transparent color) by calling
   overlayContext().

   On X servers in which the default visual is in an overlay plane,
   non-GL Qt windows can also be used for overlays.

Member Function Documentation

  QGLWidget::QGLWidget ( QWidget * parent = 0, const QGLWidget * shareWidget =
  0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   Constructs an OpenGL widget with a parent widget.

   The default format is used. The widget will be invalid if the system
   has no OpenGL support.

   The parent and widget flag, f, arguments are passed to the QWidget
   constructor.

   If the shareWidget parameter points to a valid QGLWidget, this widget
   will share OpenGL display lists with shareWidget. If this widget and
   shareWidget have different formats, display list sharing may fail. You
   can check whether display list sharing succeeded by calling
   isSharing().

   The initialization of OpenGL rendering state, etc. should be done by
   overriding the initializeGL() function, rather than in the constructor
   of your QGLWidget subclass.

   See also QGLFormat::defaultFormat().

  QGLWidget::QGLWidget ( QGLContext * context, QWidget * parent = 0, const
  QGLWidget * shareWidget = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   Constructs an OpenGL widget with parent parent.

   The context argument is a pointer to the QGLContext that you wish to
   be bound to this widget. This allows you to pass in your own
   QGLContext sub-classes.

   The widget will be invalid if the system has no OpenGL support.

   The parent and widget flag, f, arguments are passed to the QWidget
   constructor.

   If the shareWidget parameter points to a valid QGLWidget, this widget
   will share OpenGL display lists with shareWidget. If this widget and
   shareWidget have different formats, display list sharing may fail. You
   can check whether display list sharing succeeded by calling
   isSharing().

   The initialization of OpenGL rendering state, etc. should be done by
   overriding the initializeGL() function, rather than in the constructor
   of your QGLWidget subclass.

   See also QGLFormat::defaultFormat() and isValid().

  QGLWidget::QGLWidget ( const QGLFormat & format, QWidget * parent = 0, const
  QGLWidget * shareWidget = 0, Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   Constructs an OpenGL widget with parent parent.

   The format argument specifies the desired rendering options. If the
   underlying OpenGL/Window system cannot satisfy all the features
   requested in format, the nearest subset of features will be used.
   After creation, the format() method will return the actual format
   obtained.

   The widget will be invalid if the system has no OpenGL support.

   The parent and widget flag, f, arguments are passed to the QWidget
   constructor.

   If the shareWidget parameter points to a valid QGLWidget, this widget
   will share OpenGL display lists with shareWidget. If this widget and
   shareWidget have different formats, display list sharing may fail. You
   can check whether display list sharing succeeded by calling
   isSharing().

   The initialization of OpenGL rendering state, etc. should be done by
   overriding the initializeGL() function, rather than in the constructor
   of your QGLWidget subclass.

   See also QGLFormat::defaultFormat() and isValid().

  QGLWidget::~QGLWidget ()

   Destroys the widget.

  bool QGLWidget::autoBufferSwap () const   [protected]

   Returns true if the widget is doing automatic GL buffer swapping;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also setAutoBufferSwap().

  GLuint QGLWidget::bindTexture ( const QImage & image, GLenum target =
  GL_TEXTURE_2D, GLint format = GL_RGBA8 )

   Calls QGLContext:::bindTexture(image, target, format) on the currently
   set context.

   See also deleteTexture().

  GLuint QGLWidget::bindTexture ( const QPixmap & pixmap, GLenum target =
  GL_TEXTURE_2D, GLint format = GL_RGBA8 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Calls QGLContext:::bindTexture(pixmap, target, format) on the
   currently set context.

   See also deleteTexture().

  GLuint QGLWidget::bindTexture ( const QString & fileName )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Calls QGLContext::bindTexture(fileName) on the currently set context.

   See also deleteTexture().

  const QGLColormap & QGLWidget::colormap () const

   Returns the colormap for this widget.

   Usually it is only top-level widgets that can have different colormaps
   installed. Asking for the colormap of a child widget will return the
   colormap for the child's top-level widget.

   If no colormap has been set for this widget, the QColormap returned
   will be empty.

   See also setColormap().

  const QGLContext * QGLWidget::context () const

   Returns the context of this widget.

   It is possible that the context is not valid (see isValid()), for
   example, if the underlying hardware does not support the format
   attributes that were requested.

  QImage QGLWidget::convertToGLFormat ( const QImage & img )   [static]

   Converts the image img into the unnamed format expected by OpenGL
   functions such as glTexImage2D(). The returned image is not usable as
   a QImage, but QImage::width(), QImage::height() and QImage::bits() may
   be used with OpenGL.

  void QGLWidget::deleteTexture ( GLuint id )

   Calls QGLContext::deleteTexture(id) on the currently set context.

   See also bindTexture().

  void QGLWidget::doneCurrent ()

   Makes no GL context the current context. Normally, you do not need to
   call this function; QGLContext calls it as necessary. However, it may
   be useful in multithreaded environments.

  bool QGLWidget::doubleBuffer () const

   Returns true if the contained GL rendering context has double
   buffering; otherwise returns false.

   See also QGLFormat::doubleBuffer().

  int QGLWidget::fontDisplayListBase ( const QFont & fnt, int listBase = 2000
  )   [protected]

   Returns the value of the first display list that is generated for the
   characters in font fnt. listBase indicates the base value used when
   generating the display lists for the font. The default value is 2000.

  QGLFormat QGLWidget::format () const

   Returns the format of the contained GL rendering context.

  void QGLWidget::glDraw ()   [virtual protected]

   Executes the virtual function paintGL().

   The widget's rendering context will become the current context and
   initializeGL() will be called if it hasn't already been called.

  void QGLWidget::glInit ()   [virtual protected]

   Initializes OpenGL for this widget's context. Calls the virtual
   function initializeGL().

  QImage QGLWidget::grabFrameBuffer ( bool withAlpha = false )

   Returns an image of the frame buffer. If withAlpha is true the alpha
   channel is included.

   Depending on your hardware, you can explicitly select which color
   buffer to grab with a glReadBuffer() call before calling this
   function.

  void QGLWidget::initializeGL ()   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is called once before the first call to
   paintGL() or resizeGL(), and then once whenever the widget has been
   assigned a new QGLContext. Reimplement it in a subclass.

   This function should set up any required OpenGL context rendering
   flags, defining display lists, etc.

   There is no need to call makeCurrent() because this has already been
   done when this function is called.

  void QGLWidget::initializeOverlayGL ()   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is used in the same manner as initializeGL()
   except that it operates on the widget's overlay context instead of the
   widget's main context. This means that initializeOverlayGL() is called
   once before the first call to paintOverlayGL() or resizeOverlayGL().
   Reimplement it in a subclass.

   This function should set up any required OpenGL context rendering
   flags, defining display lists, etc. for the overlay context.

   There is no need to call makeOverlayCurrent() because this has already
   been done when this function is called.

  bool QGLWidget::isSharing () const

   Returns true if this widget's GL context is shared with another GL
   context, otherwise false is returned. The GL system may fail to
   provide context sharing if the two QGLWidgets use different formats.

   See also format().

  bool QGLWidget::isValid () const

   Returns true if the widget has a valid GL rendering context; otherwise
   returns false. A widget will be invalid if the system has no OpenGL
   support.

  void QGLWidget::makeCurrent ()

   Makes this widget the current widget for OpenGL operations, i.e. makes
   the widget's rendering context the current OpenGL rendering context.

  void QGLWidget::makeOverlayCurrent ()

   Makes the overlay context of this widget current. Use this if you need
   to issue OpenGL commands to the overlay context outside of
   initializeOverlayGL(), resizeOverlayGL(), and paintOverlayGL().

   Does nothing if this widget has no overlay.

   See also makeCurrent().

  const QGLContext * QGLWidget::overlayContext () const

   Returns the overlay context of this widget, or 0 if this widget has no
   overlay.

   See also context().

  void QGLWidget::paintEvent ( QPaintEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   Handles paint events passed in the event parameter. Will cause the
   virtual paintGL() function to be called.

   The widget's rendering context will become the current context and
   initializeGL() will be called if it hasn't already been called.

   Reimplemented from QWidget.

  void QGLWidget::paintGL ()   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is called whenever the widget needs to be
   painted. Reimplement it in a subclass.

   There is no need to call makeCurrent() because this has already been
   done when this function is called.

  void QGLWidget::paintOverlayGL ()   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is used in the same manner as paintGL() except
   that it operates on the widget's overlay context instead of the
   widget's main context. This means that paintOverlayGL() is called
   whenever the widget's overlay needs to be painted. Reimplement it in a
   subclass.

   There is no need to call makeOverlayCurrent() because this has already
   been done when this function is called.

  void QGLWidget::qglClearColor ( const QColor & c ) const

   Convenience function for specifying the clearing color to OpenGL.
   Calls glClearColor (in RGBA mode) or glClearIndex (in color-index
   mode) with the color c. Applies to the current GL context.

   See also qglColor(), QGLContext::currentContext(), and QColor.

  void QGLWidget::qglColor ( const QColor & c ) const

   Convenience function for specifying a drawing color to OpenGL. Calls
   glColor4 (in RGBA mode) or glIndex (in color-index mode) with the
   color c. Applies to the current GL context.

   See also qglClearColor(), QGLContext::currentContext(), and QColor.

  QPixmap QGLWidget::renderPixmap ( int w = 0, int h = 0, bool useContext =
  false )

   Renders the current scene on a pixmap and returns the pixmap.

   You can use this method on both visible and invisible QGLWidgets.

   This method will create a pixmap and a temporary QGLContext to render
   on the pixmap. It will then call initializeGL(), resizeGL(), and
   paintGL() on this context. Finally, the widget's original GL context
   is restored.

   The size of the pixmap will be w pixels wide and h pixels high unless
   one of these parameters is 0 (the default), in which case the pixmap
   will have the same size as the widget.

   If useContext is true, this method will try to be more efficient by
   using the existing GL context to render the pixmap. The default is
   false. Only use true if you understand the risks.

   Overlays are not rendered onto the pixmap.

   If the GL rendering context and the desktop have different bit depths,
   the result will most likely look surprising.

   Note that the creation of display lists, modifications of the view
   frustum etc. should be done from within initializeGL(). If this is not
   done, the temporary QGLContext will not be initialized properly, and
   the rendered pixmap may be incomplete/corrupted.

  void QGLWidget::renderText ( int x, int y, const QString & str, const QFont &
  fnt = QFont(), int listBase = 2000 )

   Renders the string str into the GL context of this widget.

   x and y are specified in window coordinates, with the origin in the
   upper left-hand corner of the window. If fnt is not specified, the
   currently set application font will be used to render the string. To
   change the color of the rendered text you can use the glColor() call
   (or the qglColor() convenience function), just before the renderText()
   call. Note that if you have GL_LIGHTING enabled, the string will not
   appear in the color you want. You should therefore switch lighting off
   before using renderText().

   listBase specifies the index of the first display list that is
   generated by this function. The default value is 2000. 256 display
   lists will be generated, one for each of the first 256 characters in
   the font that is used to render the string. If several fonts are used
   in the same widget, the display lists for these fonts will follow the
   last generated list. You would normally not have to change this value
   unless you are using lists in the same range. The lists are deleted
   when the widget is destroyed.

  void QGLWidget::renderText ( double x, double y, double z, const QString &
  str, const QFont & fnt = QFont(), int listBase = 2000 )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   x, y and z are specified in scene or object coordinates relative to
   the currently set projection and model matrices. This can be useful if
   you want to annotate models with text labels and have the labels move
   with the model as it is rotated etc.

  void QGLWidget::resizeEvent ( QResizeEvent * event )   [virtual protected]

   Handles resize events that are passed in the event parameter. Calls
   the virtual function resizeGL().

   Reimplemented from QWidget.

  void QGLWidget::resizeGL ( int width, int height )   [virtual protected]

   This virtual function is called whenever the widget has been resized.
   The new size is passed in width and height. Reimplement it in a
   subclass.

   There is no need to call makeCurrent() because this has already been
   done when this function is called.

  void QGLWidget::resizeOverlayGL ( int width, int height )   [virtual
  protected]

   This virtual function is used in the same manner as paintGL() except
   that it operates on the widget's overlay context instead of the
   widget's main context. This means that resizeOverlayGL() is called
   whenever the widget has been resized. The new size is passed in width
   and height. Reimplement it in a subclass.

   There is no need to call makeOverlayCurrent() because this has already
   been done when this function is called.

  void QGLWidget::setAutoBufferSwap ( bool on )   [protected]

   If on is true automatic GL buffer swapping is switched on; otherwise
   it is switched off.

   If on is true and the widget is using a double-buffered format, the
   background and foreground GL buffers will automatically be swapped
   after each paintGL() call.

   The buffer auto-swapping is on by default.

   See also autoBufferSwap(), doubleBuffer(), and swapBuffers().

  void QGLWidget::setColormap ( const QGLColormap & cmap )

   Set the colormap for this widget to cmap. Usually it is only top-level
   widgets that can have colormaps installed.

   See also colormap().

  void QGLWidget::setMouseTracking ( bool enable )

   If enable is true then mouse tracking is enabled; otherwise it is
   disabled.

  void QGLWidget::swapBuffers ()

   Swaps the screen contents with an off-screen buffer. This only works
   if the widget's format specifies double buffer mode.

   Normally, there is no need to explicitly call this function because it
   is done automatically after each widget repaint, i.e. each time after
   paintGL() has been executed.

   See also doubleBuffer(), setAutoBufferSwap(), and
   QGLFormat::setDoubleBuffer().

  void QGLWidget::updateGL ()   [virtual slot]

   Updates the widget by calling glDraw().

  void QGLWidget::updateOverlayGL ()   [virtual slot]

   Updates the widget's overlay (if any). Will cause the virtual function
   paintOverlayGL() to be executed.

   The widget's rendering context will become the current context and
   initializeGL() will be called if it hasn't already been called.
