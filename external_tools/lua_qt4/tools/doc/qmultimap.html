Detailed Description

   The QMultiMap class is a convenience QMap subclass that provides
   multi-valued maps.

   QMultiMap<Key, T> is one of Qt's generic container classes. It
   inherits QMap and extends it with a few convenience functions that
   make it more suitable than QMap for storing multi-valued maps. A
   multi-valued map is a map that allows multiple values with the same
   key; QMap normally doesn't allow that, unless you call
   QMap::insertMulti().

   Because QMultiMap inherits QMap, all of QMap's functionality also
   applies to QMultiMap. For example, you can use isEmpty() to test
   whether the map is empty, and you can traverse a QMultiMap using
   QMap's iterator classes (for example, QMapIterator). But in addition,
   it provides an insert() function that corresponds to
   QMap::insertMulti(), and a replace() function that corresponds to
   QMap::insert(). It also provides convenient operator+() and
   operator+=().

   Example:
    QMultiMap<QString, int> map1, map2, map3;

    map1.insert("plenty", 100);
    map1.insert("plenty", 2000);
    // map1.size() == 2

    map2.insert("plenty", 5000);
    // map2.size() == 1

    map3 = map1 + map2;
    // map3.size() == 3

   Unlike QMap, QMultiMap provides no operator[]. Use value() or
   replace() if you want to access the most recently inserted item with a
   certain key.

   If you want to retrieve all the values for a single key, you can use
   values(const Key &key), which returns a QList<T>:
    QList<int> values = map.values("plenty");
    for (int i = 0; i < values.size(); ++i)
        cout << values.at(i) << endl;

   The items that share the same key are available from most recently to
   least recently inserted.

   If you prefer the STL-style iterators, you can call find() to get the
   iterator for the first item with a key and iterate from there:
    QMultiMap<QString, int>::iterator i = map.find("plenty");
    while (i != map.end() && i.key() == "plenty") {
        cout << i.value() << endl;
        ++i;
    }

   QMultiMap's key and value data types must be assignable data types.
   This covers most data types you are likely to encounter, but the
   compiler won't let you, for example, store a QWidget as a value;
   instead, store a QWidget *. In addition, QMultiMap's key type must
   provide operator<(). See the QMap documentation for details.

   See also QMap, QMapIterator, QMutableMapIterator, and QMultiHash.

Member Function Documentation

  QMultiMap::QMultiMap ()

   Constructs an empty map.

  QMultiMap::QMultiMap ( const QMap<Key, T> & other )

   Constructs a copy of other (which can be a QMap or a QMultiMap).

   See also operator=().

  QMap<Key, T>::iterator QMultiMap::insert ( const Key & key, const T & value )

   Inserts a new item with the key key and a value of value.

   If there is already an item with the same key in the map, this
   function will simply create a new one. (This behavior is different
   from replace(), which overwrites the value of an existing item.)

   See also replace().

  QMap<Key, T>::iterator QMultiMap::replace ( const Key & key, const T & value
  )

   Inserts a new item with the key key and a value of value.

   If there is already an item with the key key, that item's value is
   replaced with value.

   If there are multiple items with the key key, the most recently
   inserted item's value is replaced with value.

   See also insert().

  QMultiMap QMultiMap::operator+ ( const QMultiMap & other ) const

   Returns a map that contains all the items in this map in addition to
   all the items in other. If a key is common to both maps, the resulting
   map will contain the key multiple times.

   See also operator+=().

  QMultiMap & QMultiMap::operator+= ( const QMultiMap & other )

   Inserts all the items in the other map into this map and returns a
   reference to this map.

   See also insert() and operator+().
