Detailed Description

   The QPalette class contains color groups for each widget state.

   A palette consists of three color groups: Active, Disabled, and
   Inactive. All widgets in Qt contain a palette and use their palette to
   draw themselves. This makes the user interface easily configurable and
   easier to keep consistent.

   If you create a new widget we strongly recommend that you use the
   colors in the palette rather than hard-coding specific colors.

   The color groups:
     * The Active group is used for the window that has keyboard focus.
     * The Inactive group is used for other windows.
     * The Disabled group is used for widgets (not windows) that are
       disabled for some reason.

   Both active and inactive windows can contain disabled widgets.
   (Disabled widgets are often called inaccessible or grayed out.)

   In most styles, Active and Inactive look the same.

   Colors and brushes can be set for particular roles in any of a
   palette's color groups with setColor() and setBrush(). A color group
   contains a group of colors used by widgets for drawing themselves. We
   recommend that widgets use color group roles from the palette such as
   "foreground" and "base" rather than literal colors like "red" or
   "turquoise". The color roles are enumerated and defined in the
   ColorRole documentation.

   We strongly recommend that you use a system-supplied color group and
   modify that as necessary.

   To modify a color group you call the functions setColor() and
   setBrush(), depending on whether you want a pure color or a pixmap
   pattern.

   There are also corresponding color() and brush() getters, and a
   commonly used convenience function to get the ColorRole for the
   current ColorGroup: background(), foreground(), base(), etc.

   You can copy a palette using the copy constructor and test to see if
   two palettes are identical using isCopyOf().

   QPalette is optimized by the use of implicit sharing, so it is very
   efficient to pass QPalette objects as arguments.

   See also QApplication::setPalette(), QWidget::setPalette(), and
   QColor.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QPalette::ColorGroup

        Constant      Value     Description
   QPalette::Disabled   1   
   QPalette::Active     0   
   QPalette::Inactive   2   
   QPalette::Normal   Active synonym for Active

  enum QPalette::ColorRole

   The ColorRole enum defines the different symbolic color roles used in
   current GUIs.

   The central roles are:

   Constant Value Description
   QPalette::Background 10 A general background color.
   QPalette::Foreground 0 A general foreground color.
   QPalette::Base 9 Used as the background color for text entry widgets;
   usually white or another light color.
   QPalette::AlternateBase 16 Used as the alternate background color in
   views with alternating row colors (see
   QAbstractItemView::setAlternatingRowColors()).
   QPalette::Text 6 The foreground color used with Base. This is usually
   the same as the Foreground, in which case it must provide good
   contrast with Background and Base.
   QPalette::Button 1 The general button background color. This
   background can be different from Background as some styles require a
   different background color for buttons.
   QPalette::ButtonText 8 A foreground color used with the Button color.

   There are some color roles used mostly for 3D bevel and shadow
   effects. All of these are normally derived from Background, and used
   in ways that depend on that relationship. For example, buttons depend
   on it to make the bevels look attractive, and Motif scroll bars depend
   on Mid to be slightly different from Background.

   Constant Value Description
   QPalette::Light 2 Lighter than Button color.
   QPalette::Midlight 3 Between Button and Light.
   QPalette::Dark 4 Darker than Button.
   QPalette::Mid 5 Between Button and Dark.
   QPalette::Shadow 11 A very dark color. By default, the shadow color is
   Qt::black.

   Selected (marked) items have two roles:

   Constant Value Description
   QPalette::Highlight 12 A color to indicate a selected item or the
   current item. By default, the highlight color is Qt::darkBlue.
   QPalette::HighlightedText 13 A text color that contrasts with
   Highlight. By default, the highlighted text color is Qt::white.

   Finally, there is a special role for text that needs to be drawn where
   Text or Foreground would give poor contrast, such as on pressed push
   buttons. Note that text colors can be used for things other than just
   words; text colors are usually used for text, but it's quite common to
   use the text color roles for lines, icons, etc.

   Constant Value Description
   QPalette::BrightText 7 A text color that is very different from
   Foreground, and contrasts well with e.g. Dark.
   QPalette::Link 14 A text color used for unvisited hyperlinks. By
   default, the link color is Qt::blue.
   QPalette::LinkVisited 15 A text color used for already visited
   hyperlinks. By default, the linkvisited color is Qt::magenta.

   This image shows most of the color roles in use:

Member Function Documentation

  QPalette::QPalette ()

   Constructs a palette object that uses the application's default
   palette.

   See also QApplication::setPalette() and QApplication::palette().

  QPalette::QPalette ( const QColor & button )

   Constructs a palette from the button color. The other colors are
   automatically calculated, based on this color. Background will be the
   button color as well.

  QPalette::QPalette ( Qt::GlobalColor button )

   Constructs a palette from the button color. The other colors are
   automatically calculated, based on this color. Background will be the
   button color as well.

  QPalette::QPalette ( const QColor & button, const QColor & background )

   Returns the brush in color group gr, used for color role cr.

   See also color(), setBrush(), and ColorRole.

  const QBrush & QPalette::brush ( ColorRole r ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the color that has been set for color role r in the current
   ColorGroup.

   See also brush() and ColorRole.

  ColorGroup QPalette::currentColorGroup () const

   Returns true if this palette and p are copies of each other, i.e. one
   of them was created as a copy of the other and neither was
   subsequently modified; otherwise returns false. This is much stricter
   than equality.

   See also operator=() and operator==().

  bool QPalette::isEqual ( ColorGroup cg1, ColorGroup cg2 ) const

   Returns true (usually quickly) if color group cg1 is equal to cg2;
   otherwise returns false.

  const QBrush & QPalette::light () const

   Returns the light brush of the current color group.

   See also ColorRole and brush().

   Returns a number that uniquely identifies this QPalette object. The
   serial number is intended for caching. Its value may not be used for
   anything other than equality testing.

   Note that QPalette uses implicit sharing, and the serial number
   changes during the lazy copy operation (when the palette is actually
   modified), not during a shallow copy (copy constructor or assignment).
