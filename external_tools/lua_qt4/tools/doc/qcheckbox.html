Detailed Description

   The QCheckBox widget provides a checkbox with a text label.

   A QCheckBox is an option button that can be switched on (checked) or
   off (unchecked). Checkboxes are typically used to represent features
   in an application that can be enabled or disabled without affecting
   others, but different types of behavior can be implemented.

   A QButtonGroup can be used to group check buttons visually.

   Whenever a checkbox is checked or cleared it emits the signal
   stateChanged(). Connect to this signal if you want to trigger an
   action each time the checkbox changes state. You can use isChecked()
   to query whether or not a checkbox is checked.

   In addition to the usual checked and unchecked states, QCheckBox
   optionally provides a third state to indicate "no change". This is
   useful whenever you need to give the user the option of neither
   checking nor unchecking a checkbox. If you need this third state,
   enable it with setTristate(), and use checkState() to query the
   current toggle state.

   Just like QPushButton, a checkbox button displays text, and optionally
   a small icon. The text can be set in the constructor or with
   setText(); the icon is set with setIcon().

   Important inherited functions: text(), setText(), text(), pixmap(),
   setPixmap(), accel(), setAccel(), isToggleButton(), setDown(),
   isDown(), isOn(), checkState(), autoRepeat(), isExclusiveToggle(),
   group(), setAutoRepeat(), toggle(), pressed(), released(), clicked(),
   toggled(), checkState(), and stateChanged().

  enum QCheckBox::ToggleState

        Constant              Value
   QCheckBox::Off         Qt::Unchecked
   QCheckBox::NoChange Qt::PartiallyChecked
   QCheckBox::On           Qt::Checked

Property Documentation

  tristate : bool

   This property holds whether the checkbox is a tri-state checkbox.

   The default is false; i.e. the checkbox has only two states.

   Access functions:
     * bool isTristate () const
     * void setTristate ( bool y = true )

Member Function Documentation

  QCheckBox::QCheckBox ( QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a checkbox with the given parent, but with no text.

   The parent argument is passed on to the QAbstractButton constructor.

  QCheckBox::QCheckBox ( const QString & text, QWidget * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a checkbox with the given parent and text.

   The parent argument is passed on to the QAbstractButton constructor.

  Qt::CheckState QCheckBox::checkState () const

   Returns the check box's check state.

   See also setCheckState() and Qt::CheckState.

  void QCheckBox::setCheckState ( Qt::CheckState state )

   Sets the check box's check state to state.

   See also checkState() and Qt::CheckState.

  void QCheckBox::stateChanged ( int state )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted whenever the check box's state changes, i.e.
   whenever the user checks or unchecks it.

   state contains the check box's new ToggleState.
