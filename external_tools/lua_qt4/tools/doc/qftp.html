Detailed Description

   The QFtp class provides an implementation of the FTP protocol.

   This class provides a client for the FTP protocol.

   The class works asynchronously, so there are no blocking functions. If
   an operation cannot be executed immediately, the function will still
   return straight away and the operation will be scheduled for later
   execution. The results of scheduled operations are reported via
   signals. This approach depends on the event loop being in operation.

   The operations that can be scheduled (they are called "commands" in
   the rest of the documentation) are the following: connectToHost(),
   login(), close(), list(), cd(), get(), put(), remove(), mkdir(),
   rmdir(), rename() and rawCommand().

   All of these commands return a unique identifier that allows you to
   keep track of the command that is currently being executed. When the
   execution of a command starts, the commandStarted() signal with the
   command's identifier is emitted. When the command is finished, the
   commandFinished() signal is emitted with the command's identifier and
   a bool that indicates whether the command finished with an error.

   In some cases, you might want to execute a sequence of commands, e.g.
   if you want to connect and login to a FTP server. This is simply
   achieved:
    QFtp *ftp = new QFtp(this); // this is an optional QObject parent
    ftp->connectToHost("ftp.trolltech.com");
    ftp->login();

   In this case two FTP commands have been scheduled. When the last
   scheduled command has finished, a done() signal is emitted with a bool
   argument that tells you whether the sequence finished with an error.

   If an error occurs during the execution of one of the commands in a
   sequence of commands, all the pending commands (i.e. scheduled, but
   not yet executed commands) are cleared and no signals are emitted for
   them.

   Some commands, e.g. list(), emit additional signals to report their
   results.

   Example: If you want to download the INSTALL file from Trolltech's FTP
   server, you would write this:
    ftp->connectToHost("ftp.trolltech.com");  // id == 1
    ftp->login();                             // id == 2
    ftp->cd("qt");                            // id == 3
    ftp->get("INSTALL");                      // id == 4
    ftp->close();                             // id == 5

   For this example the following sequence of signals is emitted (with
   small variations, depending on network traffic, etc.):
    start(1)
    stateChanged(HostLookup)
    stateChanged(Connecting)
    stateChanged(Connected)
    finished(1, false)

    start(2)
    stateChanged(LoggedIn)
    finished(2, false)

    start(3)
    finished(3, false)

    start(4)
    dataTransferProgress(0, 3798)
    dataTransferProgress(2896, 3798)
    readyRead()
    dataTransferProgress(3798, 3798)
    readyRead()
    finished(4, false)

    start(5)
    stateChanged(Closing)
    stateChanged(Unconnected)
    finished(5, false)

    done(false)

   The dataTransferProgress() signal in the above example is useful if
   you want to show a progressbar to inform the user about the progress
   of the download. The readyRead() signal tells you that there is data
   ready to be read. The amount of data can be queried then with the
   bytesAvailable() function and it can be read with the read() or
   readAll() function.

   If the login fails for the above example, the signals would look like
   this:
    start(1)
    stateChanged(HostLookup)
    stateChanged(Connecting)
    stateChanged(Connected)
    finished(1, false)

    start(2)
    finished(2, true)

    done(true)

   You can then get details about the error with the error() and
   errorString() functions.

   For file transfer, QFtp can use both active or passive mode, and it
   uses passive file transfer mode by default; see the documentation for
   setTransferMode() for more details about this.

   Call setProxy() to make QFtp connect via an FTP proxy server.

   The functions currentId() and currentCommand() provide more
   information about the currently executing command.

   The functions hasPendingCommands() and clearPendingCommands() allow
   you to query and clear the list of pending commands.

   If you are an experienced network programmer and want to have complete
   control you can use rawCommand() to execute arbitrary FTP commands.

   The FTP example illustrates how to write FTP clients using QFtp.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QFtp::Command

   This enum is used as the return value for the currentCommand()
   function. This allows you to perform specific actions for particular
   commands, e.g. in a FTP client, you might want to clear the directory
   view when a list() command is started; in this case you can simply
   check in the slot connected to the start() signal if the
   currentCommand() is List.

         Constant        Value            Description
   QFtp::None              0   No command is being executed.
   QFtp::SetTransferMode   1   set the transfer mode.
   QFtp::SetProxy          2   switch proxying on or off.
   QFtp::ConnectToHost     3   connectToHost() is being executed.
   QFtp::Login             4   login() is being executed.
   QFtp::Close             5   close() is being executed.
   QFtp::List              6   list() is being executed.
   QFtp::Cd                7   cd() is being executed.
   QFtp::Get               8   get() is being executed.
   QFtp::Put               9   put() is being executed.

   QFtp::Rename           13   rename() is being executed.
   QFtp::RawCommand       14   rawCommand() is being executed.

   See also currentCommand().

  enum QFtp::Error

   This enum identifies the error that occurred.

   Constant Value Description
   QFtp::NoError 0 No error occurred.
   QFtp::HostNotFound 2 The host name lookup failed.
   QFtp::ConnectionRefused 3 The server refused the connection.
   QFtp::NotConnected 4 Tried to send a command, but there is no
   connection to a server.
   QFtp::UnknownError 1 An error other than those specified above
   occurred.

   See also error().

  enum QFtp::State

   This enum defines the connection state:

   Constant Value Description
   QFtp::Unconnected 0 There is no connection to the host.
   QFtp::HostLookup 1 A host name lookup is in progress.

   QFtp::Connected 3 Connection to the host has been achieved.
   QFtp::LoggedIn 4 Connection and user login have been achieved.
   QFtp::Closing 5 The connection is closing down, but it is not yet
   closed. (The state will be Unconnected when the connection is closed.)

   See also stateChanged() and state().

  enum QFtp::TransferMode

   FTP works with two socket connections; one for commands and another
   for transmitting data. While the command connection is always
   initiated by the client, the second connection can be initiated by
   either the client or the server.

   This enum defines whether the client (Passive mode) or the server
   (Active mode) should set up the data connection.

   Constant Value Description
   QFtp::Passive 1 The client connects to the server to transmit its
   data.
   QFtp::Active 0 The server connects to the client to transmit its data.

  enum QFtp::TransferType

   This enum identifies the data transfer type used with get and put
   commands.

   Constant Value Description
   QFtp::Binary 0 The data will be transferred in Binary mode.
   QFtp::Ascii 1 The data will be transferred in Ascii mode and new line
   characters will be converted to the local format.

Member Function Documentation

  QFtp::QFtp ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Constructs a QFtp object with the given parent.

  QFtp::~QFtp ()   [virtual]

   Destructor.

  void QFtp::abort ()   [slot]

   Aborts the current command and deletes all scheduled commands.

   If there is an unfinished command (i.e. a command for which the
   commandStarted() signal has been emitted, but for which the
   commandFinished() signal has not been emitted), this function sends an
   ABORT command to the server. When the server replies that the command
   is aborted, the commandFinished() signal with the error argument set
   to true is emitted for the command. Due to timing issues, it is
   possible that the command had already finished before the abort
   request reached the server, in which case, the commandFinished()
   signal is emitted with the error argument set to false.

   For all other commands that are affected by the abort(), no signals
   are emitted.

   If you don't start further FTP commands directly after the abort(),
   there won't be any scheduled commands and the done() signal is
   emitted.

   Warning: Some FTP servers, for example the BSD FTP daemon (version
   0.3), wrongly return a positive reply even when an abort has occurred.
   For these servers the commandFinished() signal has its error flag set
   to false, even though the command did not complete successfully.

   See also clearPendingCommands().

  qint64 QFtp::bytesAvailable () const

   Returns the number of bytes that can be read from the data socket at
   the moment.

   See also get(), readyRead(), read(), and readAll().

  int QFtp::cd ( const QString & dir )

   Changes the working directory of the server to dir.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also commandStarted() and commandFinished().

  void QFtp::clearPendingCommands ()

   Deletes all pending commands from the list of scheduled commands. This
   does not affect the command that is being executed. If you want to
   stop this this as well, use abort().

   See also hasPendingCommands() and abort().

  int QFtp::close ()

   Closes the connection to the FTP server.

   The stateChanged() signal is emitted when the state of the connecting
   process changes, e.g. to Closing, then Unconnected.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also stateChanged(), commandStarted(), and commandFinished().

  void QFtp::commandFinished ( int id, bool error )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when processing the command identified by id
   has finished. error is true if an error occurred during the
   processing; otherwise error is false.

   See also commandStarted(), done(), error(), and errorString().

  void QFtp::commandStarted ( int id )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when processing the command identified by id
   starts.

   See also commandFinished() and done().

  int QFtp::connectToHost ( const QString & host, quint16 port = 21 )

   Connects to the FTP server host using port port.

   The stateChanged() signal is emitted when the state of the connecting
   process changes, e.g. to HostLookup, then Connecting, then Connected.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also stateChanged(), commandStarted(), and commandFinished().

  Command QFtp::currentCommand () const

   Returns the command type of the FTP command being executed or None if
   there is no command being executed.

   See also currentId().

  QIODevice * QFtp::currentDevice () const

   Returns the QIODevice pointer that is used by the FTP command to read
   data from or store data to. If there is no current FTP command being
   executed or if the command does not use an IO device, this function
   returns 0.

   This function can be used to delete the QIODevice in the slot
   connected to the commandFinished() signal.

   See also get() and put().

  int QFtp::currentId () const

   Returns the identifier of the FTP command that is being executed or 0
   if there is no command being executed.

   See also currentCommand().

  void QFtp::dataTransferProgress ( qint64 done, qint64 total )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted in response to a get() or put() request to
   indicate the current progress of the download or upload.

   done is the amount of data that has already been transferred and total
   is the total amount of data to be read or written. It is possible that
   the QFtp class is not able to determine the total amount of data that
   should be transferred, in which case total is 0. (If you connect this
   signal to a QProgressBar, the progress bar shows a busy indicator if
   the total is 0).

   Warning: done and total are not necessarily the size in bytes, since
   for large files these values might need to be "scaled" to avoid
   overflow.

   See also get(), put(), and QProgressBar.

  void QFtp::done ( bool error )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the last pending command has finished; (it
   is emitted after the last command's commandFinished() signal). error
   is true if an error occurred during the processing; otherwise error is
   false.

   See also commandFinished(), error(), and errorString().

  Error QFtp::error () const

   Returns the last error that occurred. This is useful to find out what
   when wrong when receiving a commandFinished() or a done() signal with
   the error argument set to true.

   If you start a new command, the error status is reset to NoError.

  QString QFtp::errorString () const

   Returns a human-readable description of the last error that occurred.
   This is useful for presenting a error message to the user when
   receiving a commandFinished() or a done() signal with the error
   argument set to true.

   The error string is often (but not always) the reply from the server,
   so it is not always possible to translate the string. If the message
   comes from Qt, the string has already passed through tr().

  int QFtp::get ( const QString & file, QIODevice * dev = 0, TransferType type
  = Binary )

   Downloads the file file from the server.

   If dev is 0, then the readyRead() signal is emitted when there is data
   available to read. You can then read the data with the read() or
   readAll() functions.

   If dev is not 0, the data is written directly to the device dev. Make
   sure that the dev pointer is valid for the duration of the operation
   (it is safe to delete it when the commandFinished() signal is
   emitted). In this case the readyRead() signal is not emitted and you
   cannot read data with the readBlcok or readAll() functions.

   If you don't read the data immediately it becomes available, i.e. when
   the readyRead() signal is emitted, it is still available until the
   next command is started.

   For example, if you want to present the data to the user as soon as
   there is something available, connect to the readyRead() signal and
   read the data immediately. On the other hand, if you only want to work
   with the complete data, you can connect to the commandFinished()
   signal and read the data when the get() command is finished.

   The data is transferred as Binary or Ascii depending on the value of
   type.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   commandFinished()

   See also readyRead(), dataTransferProgress(), and commandStarted().

  bool QFtp::hasPendingCommands () const

   Returns true if there are any commands scheduled that have not yet
   been executed; otherwise returns false.

   The command that is being executed is not considered as a scheduled
   command.

   See also clearPendingCommands(), currentId(), and currentCommand().

  int QFtp::list ( const QString & dir = QString() )

   Lists the contents of directory dir on the FTP server. If dir is
   empty, it lists the contents of the current directory.

   The listInfo() signal is emitted for each directory entry found.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also listInfo(), commandStarted(), and commandFinished().

  void QFtp::listInfo ( const QUrlInfo & i )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted for each directory entry the list() command
   finds. The details of the entry are stored in i.

   See also list().

  int QFtp::login ( const QString & user = QString(), const QString & password
  = QString() )

   Logs in to the FTP server with the username user and the password
   password.

   The stateChanged() signal is emitted when the state of the connecting
   process changes, e.g. to LoggedIn.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also commandStarted() and commandFinished().

  int QFtp::mkdir ( const QString & dir )

   Creates a directory called dir on the server.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also commandStarted() and commandFinished().

  int QFtp::put ( QIODevice * dev, const QString & file, TransferType type =
  Binary )

   Reads the data from the IO device dev, and writes it to the file
   called file on the server. The data is read in chunks from the IO
   device, so this overload allows you to transmit large amounts of data
   without the need to read all the data into memory at once.

   The data is transferred as Binary or Ascii depending on the value of
   type.

   Make sure that the dev pointer is valid for the duration of the
   operation (it is safe to delete it when the commandFinished() is
   emitted).

  int QFtp::put ( const QByteArray & data, const QString & file, TransferType
  type = Binary )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Writes a copy of the given data to the file called file on the server.
   The progress of the upload is reported by the dataTransferProgress()
   signal.

   The data is transferred as Binary or Ascii depending on the value of
   type.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   Since this function takes a copy of the data, you can discard your own
   copy when this function returns.

   See also dataTransferProgress(), commandStarted(), and
   commandFinished().

  int QFtp::rawCommand ( const QString & command )

   Sends the raw FTP command command to the FTP server. This is useful
   for low-level FTP access. If the operation you wish to perform has an
   equivalent QFtp function, we recommend using the function instead of
   raw FTP commands since the functions are easier and safer.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also rawCommandReply(), commandStarted(), and commandFinished().

  void QFtp::rawCommandReply ( int replyCode, const QString & detail )
  [signal]

   This signal is emitted in response to the rawCommand() function.
   replyCode is the 3 digit reply code and detail is the text that
   follows the reply code.

   See also rawCommand().

  qint64 QFtp::read ( char * data, qint64 maxlen )

   Reads maxlen bytes from the data socket into data and returns the
   number of bytes read. Returns -1 if an error occurred.

   See also get(), readyRead(), bytesAvailable(), and readAll().

  QByteArray QFtp::readAll ()

   Reads all the bytes available from the data socket and returns them.

   See also get(), readyRead(), bytesAvailable(), and read().

  void QFtp::readyRead ()   [signal]

   This signal is emitted in response to a get() command when there is
   new data to read.

   If you specify a device as the second argument in the get() command,
   this signal is not emitted; instead the data is written directly to
   the device.

   You can read the data with the readAll() or read() functions.

   This signal is useful if you want to process the data in chunks as
   soon as it becomes available. If you are only interested in the
   complete data, just connect to the commandFinished() signal and read
   the data then instead.

   See also get(), read(), readAll(), and bytesAvailable().

  int QFtp::remove ( const QString & file )

   Deletes the file called file from the server.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also commandStarted() and commandFinished().

  int QFtp::rename ( const QString & oldname, const QString & newname )

   Renames the file called oldname to newname on the server.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also commandStarted() and commandFinished().

  int QFtp::rmdir ( const QString & dir )

   Removes the directory called dir from the server.

   The function does not block and returns immediately. The command is
   scheduled, and its execution is performed asynchronously. The function
   returns a unique identifier which is passed by commandStarted() and
   commandFinished().

   When the command is started the commandStarted() signal is emitted.
   When it is finished the commandFinished() signal is emitted.

   See also commandStarted() and commandFinished().

  int QFtp::setProxy ( const QString & host, quint16 port )

   Enables use of the FTP proxy on host host and port port. Calling this
   function with host empty disables proxying.

   QFtp does not support FTP-over-HTTP proxy servers. Use QHttp for this.

  int QFtp::setTransferMode ( TransferMode mode )

   Sets the current FTP transfer mode to mode. The default is
   QFtp::Passive.

   See also QFtp::TransferMode.

  State QFtp::state () const

   Returns the current state of the object. When the state changes, the
   stateChanged() signal is emitted.

   See also State and stateChanged().

  void QFtp::stateChanged ( int state )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the state of the connection changes. The
   argument state is the new state of the connection; it is one of the
   State values.

   It is usually emitted in response to a connectToHost() or close()
   command, but it can also be emitted "spontaneously", e.g. when the
   server closes the connection unexpectedly.

   See also connectToHost(), close(), state(), and State.
