Detailed Description

   The QSplashScreen widget provides a splash screen that can be shown
   during application startup.

   A splash screen is a widget that is usually displayed when an
   application is being started. Splash screens are often used for
   applications that have long start up times (e.g. database or
   networking applications that take time to establish connections) to
   provide the user with feedback that the application is loading.

   The splash screen appears centered on the screen. It may be useful to
   add the Qt::WStyle_StaysOnTop if you desire to keep above all the
   windows in the GUI.

   Some X11 window managers do not support the "stays on top" flag. A
   solution is to set up a timer that periodically calls raise() on the
   splash screen to simulate the "stays on top" effect.

   The most common usage is to show a splash screen before the main
   widget is displayed on the screen. This is illustrated in the
   following code snippet.
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        QApplication app(argc, argv);
        QPixmap pixmap("splash.png");
        QSplashScreen *splash = new QSplashScreen(pixmap);
        splash->show();
        QMainWindow *mainWin = new QMainWindow;
        ...
        app.setMainWidget(mainWin);
        mainWin->show();
        splash->finish(mainWin);
        delete splash;
        return app.exec();
    }

   It is sometimes useful to update the splash screen with messages, for
   example, announcing connections established or modules loaded as the
   application starts up. QSplashScreen supports this with the
   showMessage() function. If you wish to do your own drawing you can get
   a pointer to the pixmap used in the splash screen with pixmap().
   Alternatively, you can subclass QSplashScreen and reimplement
   drawContents().

   The user can hide the splash screen by clicking on it with the mouse.
   Since the splash screen is typically displayed before the event loop
   has started running, it is necessary to periodically call
   QApplication::processEvents() to receive the mouse clicks.
    QSplashScreen *splash = new QSplashScreen("splash.png");
    splash->show();
    ... // Loading some items
    splash->showMessage("Loaded modules");
    qApp->processEvents();
    ... // Establishing connections
    splash->showMessage("Established connections");
    qApp->processEvents();

Member Function Documentation

  QSplashScreen::QSplashScreen ( const QPixmap & pixmap = QPixmap(), Qt::WFlags
  f = 0 )

   Construct a splash screen that will display the pixmap.

   There should be no need to set the widget flags, f, except perhaps
   Qt::WStyle_StaysOnTop.

  QSplashScreen::QSplashScreen ( QWidget * parent, const QPixmap & pixmap =
  QPixmap(), Qt::WFlags f = 0 )

   This function allows you to specify a parent for your splashscreen.
   The typical use for this constructor is if you have a multiple screens
   and prefer to have the splash screen on a different screen than your
   primary one. In that case pass the proper desktop() as the parent.

  QSplashScreen::~QSplashScreen ()   [virtual]

   Destructor.

  void QSplashScreen::clearMessage ()   [slot]

   Removes the message being displayed on the splash screen

   See also showMessage().

  void QSplashScreen::drawContents ( QPainter * painter )   [virtual protected]

   Draw the contents of the splash screen using painter painter. The
   default implementation draws the message passed by showMessage().
   Reimplement this function if you want to do your own drawing on the
   splash screen.

  void QSplashScreen::finish ( QWidget * mainWin )

   Makes the splash screen wait until the widget mainWin is displayed
   before calling close() on itself.

  void QSplashScreen::messageChanged ( const QString & message )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the message on the splash screen changes.
   message is the new message and is a null-string when the message has
   been removed.

   See also showMessage() and clearMessage().

  const QPixmap QSplashScreen::pixmap () const

   Returns the pixmap that is used in the splash screen. The image does
   not have any of the text drawn by showMessage() calls.

  void QSplashScreen::repaint ()

   This overrides QWidget::repaint(). It differs from the standard
   repaint function in that it also calls QApplication::flush() to ensure
   the updates are displayed, even when there is no event loop present.

  void QSplashScreen::setPixmap ( const QPixmap & pixmap )

   Sets the pixmap that will be used as the splash screen's image to
   pixmap.

  void QSplashScreen::showMessage ( const QString & message, int alignment =
  Qt::AlignLeft, const QColor & color = Qt::black )   [slot]

   Draws the message text onto the splash screen with color color and
   aligns the text according to the flags in alignment.

   See also Qt::Alignment and clearMessage().
