Detailed Description

   The QTemporaryFile class is an I/O device that operates on temporary
   files.

   QTemporaryFile is an I/O device that will get its input/output from
   the local disk. The filename for the temporary file will be guaranteed
   to be unique once the file is opened and will subsequently be removed
   upon destruction of the QTemporaryFile object.

   A temporary file will have some static part of the name and some part
   that is calculated to be unique. The default filename qt_temp will be
   placed into the temporary path as returned by QDir::tempPath().

   See also QDir::tempPath() and QFile.

Member Function Documentation

  QTemporaryFile::QTemporaryFile ()

   Constructs a QTemporaryFile with no name.

   See also setFileTemplate().

  QTemporaryFile::QTemporaryFile ( const QString & templateName )

   Constructs a QTemporaryFile with a template filename of templateName.
   Upon opening the temporary file this will be used to create a unique
   filename. If the templateName does end in XXXXXX it will automatically
   be appended and used as the dynamic portion of the filename.

   See also open() and fileTemplate().

  QTemporaryFile::QTemporaryFile ( QObject * parent )

   Constructs a QTemporaryFile with the given parent, but with no name.

   See also setFileTemplate().

  QTemporaryFile::QTemporaryFile ( const QString & templateName, QObject *
  parent )

   Constructs a QTemporaryFile with a template filename of templateName
   and the specified parent. Upon opening the temporary file this will be
   used to create a unique filename. If the templateName does end in
   XXXXXX it will automatically be appended and used as the dynamic
   portion of the filename.

   See also open() and fileTemplate().

  QTemporaryFile::~QTemporaryFile ()

   Destroys the temporary file object, the file is automatically closed
   if necessary and if in auto remove mode it will automatically delete
   the file.

   See also autoRemove().

  bool QTemporaryFile::autoRemove () const

   Returns true if the QTemporaryFile is in auto remove mode. Auto-remove
   mode will automatically delete the filename from disk upon
   destruction. This makes it very easy to create your QTemporaryFile
   object on the stack, fill it with data, read from it, and finally on
   function return it will automatically clean up after itself.

   See also setAutoRemove() and remove().

  QTemporaryFile * QTemporaryFile::createLocalFile ( const QString & fileName
  )   [static]

   Works on the given fileName rather than an existing QFile object.

  QTemporaryFile * QTemporaryFile::createLocalFile ( QFile & file )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Creates and returns a local temporary file whose contents are a copy
   of the contens of the given file.

  QString QTemporaryFile::fileName () const

   Returns the complete unique filename backing the QTemporaryFile
   object. This string is null before the QTemporaryFile is opened,
   afterwards it will contain the fileTemplate() plus additional
   characters to make it unique.

   See also fileTemplate().

  QString QTemporaryFile::fileTemplate () const

   Returns the set file template. The default file template will be
   called qt_temp and be placed in QDir::tempPath().

   See also setFileTemplate().

  bool QTemporaryFile::open ()

   A QTemporaryFile will always be opened in QIODevice::ReadWrite mode,
   this allows easy access to the data in the file. This function will
   return true upon success and will set the fileName() to the unique
   filename used.

   See also fileName().

  void QTemporaryFile::setAutoRemove ( bool b )

   Sets the QTemporaryFile into auto-remove mode if b is true.

   See also autoRemove() and remove().

  void QTemporaryFile::setFileTemplate ( const QString & name )

   Sets the static portion of the file name to name. If the file template
   ends in XXXXXX that will automatically be replaced with the unique
   part of the filename, otherwise a filename will be determined
   automatically based on the static portion specified.

   See also fileTemplate().
