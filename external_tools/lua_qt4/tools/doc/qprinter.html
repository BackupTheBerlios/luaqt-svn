Detailed Description

   The QPrinter class is a paint device that paints on a printer.

   On Windows or Mac OS X, QPrinter uses the built-in printer drivers. On
   X11, QPrinter generates postscript and sends that to lpr, lp, or
   another printProgram(). QPrinter can also print to any other
   QPrintEngine.

   QPrinter is used in much the same way as QWidget and QPixmap are used.
   The big difference is that you must keep track of pages.

   QPrinter supports a number of settable parameters, most of which can
   be changed by the end user through a QAbstractPrintDialog print
   dialog. In general, QPrinter passes these functions onto the
   underlying QPrintEngine.

   The most important parameters are:
     * setOrientation() tells QPrinter which page orientation to use.
     * setPageSize() tells QPrinter what page size to expect from the
       printer.
     * setResolution() tells QPrinter what resolution you wish the
       printer to provide (in dots per inch -- dpi).
     * setFullPage() tells QPrinter whether you want to deal with the
       full page or just with the part the printer can draw on. The
       default is false, so that by default you should be able to paint
       on (0,0). If true the origin of the coordinate system will be in
       the top left corner of the paper and most probably the printer
       will not be able to paint something there due to it's physical
       margins.
     * setNumCopies() tells QPrinter how many copies of the document it
       should print.

   Many of the settable functions can only be called before the actual
   printing begins (i.e., before QPainter::begin() is called). This
   usually makes sense (e.g., you can't change the number of copies when
   you are halfway through printing). There are also some settings that
   the user sets (through the printer dialog) and that applications are
   expected to obey. See QAbstractPrintDialog's documentation for more
   details.

   Once you start printing, calling newPage() is essential. You will
   probably also need to look at the device metrics for the printer.

   If you want to abort the print job, abort() will try its best to stop
   printing. It may cancel the entire job or just part of it.

   If your current locale converts "," to ".", you will need to set a
   locale that doesn't do this (e.g. the "C" locale) before using
   QPrinter.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QPrinter::ColorMode

   This enum type is used to indicate whether QPrinter should print in
   color or not.

      Constant       Value                     Description
 QPrinter::Color       1   print in color if available, otherwise in grayscale.
 QPrinter::GrayScale   0   print in grayscale, even on color printers.

  enum QPrinter::Orientation

   This enum type (not to be confused with Orientation) is used to
   specify each page's orientation.

        Constant       Value                 Description
   QPrinter::Portrait    0   the page's height is greater than its width.
   QPrinter::Landscape   1   the page's width is greater than its height.

   This type interacts with QPrinter::PageSize and
   QPrinter::setFullPage() to determine the final size of the page
   available to the application.

  enum QPrinter::PageOrder

   This enum type is used by QPrinter to tell the application program how
   to print.

   Constant Value Description
   QPrinter::FirstPageFirst 0 the lowest-numbered page should be printed
   first.
   QPrinter::LastPageFirst 1 the highest-numbered page should be printed
   first.

  enum QPrinter::PageSize

   This enum type specifies what paper size QPrinter should use. QPrinter
   does not check that the paper size is available; it just uses this
   information, together with QPrinter::Orientation and
   QPrinter::setFullPage(), to determine the printable area.

   The defined sizes (with setFullPage(true)) are:

   Constant Value Description
   QPrinter::A0 5 841 x 1189 mm
   QPrinter::A1 6 594 x 841 mm
   QPrinter::A2 7 420 x 594 mm
   QPrinter::A3 8 297 x 420 mm
   QPrinter::A4 0 210 x 297 mm, 8.26 x 11.69 inches
   QPrinter::A5 9 148 x 210 mm
   QPrinter::A6 10 105 x 148 mm
   QPrinter::A7 11 74 x 105 mm
   QPrinter::A8 12 52 x 74 mm
   QPrinter::A9 13 37 x 52 mm
   QPrinter::B0 14 1030 x 1456 mm
   QPrinter::B1 15 728 x 1030 mm
   QPrinter::B10 16 32 x 45 mm
   QPrinter::B2 17 515 x 728 mm
   QPrinter::B3 18 364 x 515 mm
   QPrinter::B4 19 257 x 364 mm
   QPrinter::B5 1 182 x 257 mm, 7.17 x 10.13 inches
   QPrinter::B6 20 128 x 182 mm
   QPrinter::B7 21 91 x 128 mm
   QPrinter::B8 22 64 x 91 mm
   QPrinter::B9 23 45 x 64 mm
   QPrinter::C5E 24 163 x 229 mm
   QPrinter::Comm10E 25 105 x 241 mm, US Common 10 Envelope
   QPrinter::DLE 26 110 x 220 mm
   QPrinter::Executive 4 7.5 x 10 inches, 191 x 254 mm
   QPrinter::Folio 27 210 x 330 mm
   QPrinter::Ledger 28 432 x 279 mm
   QPrinter::Legal 3 8.5 x 14 inches, 216 x 356 mm
   QPrinter::Letter 2 8.5 x 11 inches, 216 x 279 mm
   QPrinter::Tabloid 29 279 x 432 mm
   QPrinter::Custom 30 With setFullPage(false) (the default), the metrics
   will be a bit smaller; how much depends on the printer in use.

  enum QPrinter::PaperSource

   This enum type specifies what paper source QPrinter is to use.
   QPrinter does not check that the paper source is available; it just
   uses this information to try and set the paper source. Whether it will
   set the paper source depends on whether the printer has that
   particular source.

   Warning: This is currently only implemented for Windows.

           Constant         Value
   QPrinter::OnlyOne          0
   QPrinter::Lower            1
   QPrinter::Middle           2
   QPrinter::Manual           3
   QPrinter::Envelope         4
   QPrinter::EnvelopeManual   5
   QPrinter::Auto             6
   QPrinter::Tractor          7
   QPrinter::SmallFormat      8
   QPrinter::LargeFormat      9
   QPrinter::LargeCapacity   10
   QPrinter::Cassette        11
   QPrinter::FormSource      12

  enum QPrinter::PrintRange

   This enum is here for compatibility

        Constant       Value
   QPrinter::AllPages    0
   QPrinter::Selection   1
   QPrinter::PageRange   2

  enum QPrinter::PrinterMode

   This enum describes the mode the printer should work in. It basically
   presets a certain resolution and working mode.

   Constant Value Description
   QPrinter::ScreenResolution 0 Sets the resolution of the print device
   to the screen resolution. This has the big advantage that the results
   obtained when painting on the printer will match more or less exactly
   the visible output on the screen. It is the easiest to use, as font
   metrics on the screen and on the printer are the same. This is the
   default value. ScreenResolution will produce a lower quality output
   than HighResolution and should only be used for drafts.
   QPrinter::PrinterResolution 1 This value is deprecated. Is is
   equivalent to ScreenResolution on Unix and HighResolution on Windows
   and Mac. Due do the difference between ScreenResolution and
   HighResolution, use of this value may lead to non-portable printer
   code.
   QPrinter::HighResolution 2 Use printer resolution on Windows, and set
   the resolution of the Postscript driver to 600dpi.

  enum QPrinter::PrinterOption

   This enum is here for compatibility

           Constant         Value
   QPrinter::PrintToFile      0
   QPrinter::PrintSelection   1
   QPrinter::PrintPageRange   2

  enum QPrinter::PrinterState

       Constant      Value
   QPrinter::Idle      0
   QPrinter::Active    1
   QPrinter::Aborted   2
   QPrinter::Error     3
     _________________________________________________________________

Member Function Documentation

  QPrinter::QPrinter ( PrinterMode mode = ScreenResolution )

   Creates a new printer object with the given mode.

  QPrinter::~QPrinter ()

   Destroys the printer object and frees any allocated resources. If the
   printer is destroyed while a print job is in progress this may or may
   not affect the print job.

  bool QPrinter::abort ()

   Aborts the current print run. Returns true if the print run was
   successfully aborted and printerState() will return QPrinter::Aborted;
   otherwise returns false.

   It is not always possible to abort a print job. For example, all the
   data has gone to the printer but the printer cannot or will not cancel
   the job when asked to.

  ColorMode QPrinter::colorMode () const

   Returns the current color mode.

   See also setColorMode().

  QString QPrinter::creator () const

   Returns the name of the application that created the document.

   See also setCreator().

  QString QPrinter::docName () const

   Returns the document name.

   See also setDocName().

  bool QPrinter::fullPage () const

   Returns true if the origin of the printer's coordinate system is at
   the corner of the page and false if it is at the edge of the printable
   area.

   See setFullPage() for details and caveats.

   See also setFullPage() and PageSize.

  bool QPrinter::newPage ()

   Tells the printer to eject the current page and to continue printing
   on a new page. Returns true if this was successful; otherwise returns
   false.

  int QPrinter::numCopies () const

   Returns the number of copies to be printed. The default value is 1.

   On Windows and Mac OS X, this will always return 1 as these operating
   systems can internally handle the number of copies.

   On X11, this value will return the number of times the application is
   required to print in order to match the number specified in the
   printer setup dialog. This has been done since some printer drivers
   are not capable of buffering up the copies and in those cases the
   application must make an explicit call to the print code for each
   copy.

   See also setNumCopies().

  Orientation QPrinter::orientation () const

   Returns the orientation setting. This is driver-dependent, but is
   usually QPrinter::Portrait.

   See also setOrientation().

  QString QPrinter::outputFileName () const

   Returns the name of the output file. By default, this is an empty
   string (indicating that the printer shouldn't print to file).

   See also setOutputFileName().

  PageOrder QPrinter::pageOrder () const

   Returns the current page order.

   The default page order is FirstPageFirst.

  QRect QPrinter::pageRect () const

   Returns the page's rectangle; this is usually smaller than the
   paperRect() since the page normally has margins between its borders
   and the paper.

   See also pageSize().

  PageSize QPrinter::pageSize () const

   Returns the printer page size. The default value is driver-dependent.

   See also setPageSize(), pageRect(), and paperRect().

  QPaintEngine * QPrinter::paintEngine () const   [virtual]

   Returns the paint engine used by the printer.

   Reimplemented from QPaintDevice.

  QRect QPrinter::paperRect () const

   Returns the paper's rectangle; this is usually larger than the
   pageRect().

   See also pageRect().

  PaperSource QPrinter::paperSource () const

   Returns the printer's paper source. This is Manual or a printer tray
   or paper cassette.

  QString QPrinter::printProgram () const

   Returns the name of the program that sends the print output to the
   printer.

   The default is to return an empty string; meaning that QPrinter will
   try to be smart in a system-dependent way. On X11 only, you can set it
   to something different to use a specific print program. On the other
   platforms, this returns an empty string.

   See also setPrintProgram() and setPrinterSelectionOption().

  QString QPrinter::printerName () const

   Returns the printer name. This value is initially set to the name of
   the default printer.

   See also setPrinterName().

  QString QPrinter::printerSelectionOption () const

   Returns the printer options selection string. This is useful only if
   the print command has been explicitly set.

   The default value (an empty string) implies that the printer should be
   selected in a system-dependent manner.

   Any other value implies that the given value should be used.

   Warning: This function is not available on Windows.

   See also setPrinterSelectionOption().

  PrinterState QPrinter::printerState () const

   Returns the current state of the printer. This may not always be
   accurate (for example if the printer doesn't have the capability of
   reporting its state to the operating system).

  int QPrinter::resolution () const

   Returns the current assumed resolution of the printer, as set by
   setResolution() or by the printer driver.

   See also setResolution().

  void QPrinter::setColorMode ( ColorMode newColorMode )

   Sets the printer's color mode to newColorMode, which can be either
   Color or GrayScale.

   See also colorMode().

  void QPrinter::setCreator ( const QString & creator )

   Sets the name of the application that created the document to creator.

   This function is only applicable to the X11 version of Qt. If no
   creator name is specified, the creator will be set to "Qt" followed by
   some version number.

   See also creator().

  void QPrinter::setDocName ( const QString & name )

   Sets the document name to name.

  void QPrinter::setFullPage ( bool fp )

   Sets QPrinter to have the origin of the coordinate system at the
   top-left corner of the paper if fp is true, or where it thinks the
   top-left corner of the printable area is if fp is false.

   The default is false. You can (probably) print on (0,0), and the
   device metrics will report something smaller than the size indicated
   by PageSize. (Note that QPrinter may be wrong on Unix systems: it does
   not have perfect knowledge of the physical printer.)

   If fp is true, the device metrics will report the exact same size as
   indicated by PageSize. It probably isn't possible to print on the
   entire page because of the printer's physical margins, so the
   application must account for the margins itself.

   See also PageSize, setPageSize(), fullPage(), width(), and height().

  void QPrinter::setNumCopies ( int numCopies )

   Sets the number of copies to be printed to numCopies.

   The printer driver reads this setting and prints the specified number
   of copies.

   See also numCopies().

  void QPrinter::setOrientation ( Orientation orientation )

   Sets the print orientation to orientation.

   The orientation can be either QPrinter::Portrait or
   QPrinter::Landscape.

   The printer driver reads this setting and prints using the specified
   orientation.

   On Windows and Mac OS X, this option can be changed while printing and
   will take effect from the next call to newPage().

   See also orientation().

  void QPrinter::setOutputFileName ( const QString & fileName )

   Sets the name of the output file to fileName.

   Setting a null or empty name (0 or "") disables printing to a file.
   Setting a non-empty name enables printing to a file.

   See also outputFileName() and setOutputToFile().

  void QPrinter::setPageOrder ( PageOrder pageOrder )

   Sets the page order to pageOrder.

   The page order can be QPrinter::FirstPageFirst or
   QPrinter::LastPageFirst. The application is responsible for reading
   the page order and printing accordingly.

   This function is mostly useful for setting a default value that the
   user can override in the print dialog.

  void QPrinter::setPageSize ( PageSize newPageSize )

   Sets the printer page size to newPageSize if that size is supported.
   The result if undefined if newPageSize is not supported.

   The default page size is driver-dependent.

   This function is useful mostly for setting a default value that the
   user can override in the print dialog.

   See also pageSize(), PageSize, setFullPage(), setResolution(),
   pageRect(), and paperRect().

  void QPrinter::setPaperSource ( PaperSource source )

   Sets the paper source setting to source.

   Windows only: This option can be changed while printing and will take
   effect from the next call to newPage()

   See also paperSource().

  void QPrinter::setPrintProgram ( const QString & printProg )

   Sets the name of the program that should do the print job to
   printProg.

   On X11, this function sets the program to call with the PostScript
   output. On other platforms, it has no effect.

   See also printProgram().

  void QPrinter::setPrinterName ( const QString & name )

   Sets the printer name to name.

   See also printerName().

  void QPrinter::setPrinterSelectionOption ( const QString & option )

   Sets the printer to use option to select the printer. option is null
   by default (which implies that Qt should be smart enough to guess
   correctly), but it can be set to other values to use a specific
   printer selection option.

   If the printer selection option is changed while the printer is
   active, the current print job may or may not be affected.

   Warning: This function is not available on Windows.

   See also printerSelectionOption().

  void QPrinter::setResolution ( int dpi )

   Requests that the printer prints at dpi or as near to dpi as possible.

   This setting affects the coordinate system as returned by, for example
   QPainter::viewport().

   This function must be called before QPainter::begin() to have an
   effect on all platforms.

   See also resolution() and setPageSize().

  void QPrinter::setWinPageSize ( int pageSize )

   Sets the page size to be used by the printer under Windows to
   pageSize.

   Warning: This function is not portable so you may prefer to use
   setPageSize() instead.

   See also winPageSize().

  QList<int> QPrinter::supportedResolutions () const

   Returns a list of the resolutions (a list of dots-per-inch integers)
   that the printer says it supports.

   For X11 where all printing is directly to postscript, this function
   will always return a one item list containing only the postscript
   resolution, i.e., 72 (72 dpi -- but see PrinterMode).

  int QPrinter::winPageSize () const

   Returns the page size used by the printer under Windows.

   Warning: This function is not portable so you may prefer to use
   pageSize() instead.

   See also setWinPageSize().
