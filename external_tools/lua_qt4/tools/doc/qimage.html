Detailed Description

   The QImage class provides a hardware-independent pixmap that allows
   direct access to the pixel data, and can be used as a paint device.

   Qt provides two classes for handling image data: QImage and QPixmap.
   QImage is designed and optimized for I/O, and for direct pixel
   access/manipulation. QPixmap is designed and optimized for drawing.
   There are functions to convert between QImage and QPixmap:
   QPixmap::convertToImage() and QPixmap::convertFromImage().

   QImage supports a number of formats. These include monochrome images,
   8-bit images, and 32-bit images with an optional alpha channel.
   Monochrome and 8-bit images are indexed based and use a color lookup
   table, while 32-bit images use RGB or ARGB values.

   An entry in the color table is an RGB triplet encoded as an qRgb
   value. Use the color() function to obtain an entry from the table, and
   the qRed(), qGreen(), and qBlue() functions (qcolor.h) to access the
   components. The qRgb() function is used to make an RGB triplet
   suitable for use with the setColor() function.

   Monochrome images have a color table with at most two colors. There
   are two different types of monochrome images: big endian (MSB first)
   or little endian (LSB first) bit order. To access a single bit you
   must do some bit shifts:
            QImage image;
            // sets bit at (x, y) to 1
            if (image.format() == QImage::Format_MonoLSB)
                image.scanLine(y)[x >> 3] |= 1 << (x & 7);
            else
                image.scanLine(y)[x >> 3] |= 1 << (7 - (x & 7));

   If this looks complicated, you can convert the monochrome image to an
   8-bit indexed image using convertToFormat(). 8-bit images are much
   easier to work with than 1-bit images because they have a single byte
   per pixel:
            QImage image;
            // set entry 19 in the color table to yellow
            image.setColor(19, qRgb(255, 255, 0));

            // set 8 bit pixel at (x,y) to value yellow (in color table)
            image.scanLine(y)[x] = 19;

   32-bit images have no color table; instead, each pixel contains an
   ARGB value. 24 bits contain the RGB value; the most significant byte
   is reserved for the alpha buffer.
            QImage image;
            // sets 32 bit pixel at (x,y) to yellow.
            uint *ptr = reinterpret_cast<uint *>(image.scanLine(y)) + x;
            *ptr = qRgb(255, 255, 0);

   On Qt/Embedded, scanlines are aligned to the pixel depth and may be
   padded to any degree, while on all other platforms, the scanlines are
   32-bit aligned for all depths. The constructor taking a uchar*
   argument always expects 32-bit aligned data. On Qt/Embedded, an
   additional constructor allows the number of bytes-per-line to be
   specified.

   Pixel colors are retrieved with pixel() and set with setPixel().

   QImage supports a variety of functions that can be used to obtain
   information about the image. width(), height(), dotsPerMeterX(), and
   dotsPerMeterY() provide information about the image size and
   resolution. The depth(), numColors(), isGrayscale(), and colorTable()
   functions provide information about the color depth and available
   color components used to store the image data.

   It is possible to determine whether a color image can be safely
   converted to a grayscale image by using the allGray() function. The
   format(), bytesPerLine(), and numBytes() functions provide low-level
   information about the data stored in the image.

   QImage also supports a number of functions for creating a new image
   that is a transformed version of the original. For example,
   convertToFormat(), createAlphaMask(), createHeuristicMask(),
   mirrored(), scaled(), rgbSwapped() and transformed(). There are also
   functions for changing attributes of an image in-place, for example,
   setAlphaChannel(), setColor(), setDotsPerMeterX() and
   setDotsPerMeterY() and setNumColors().

   Images can be loaded and saved in the supported formats. Images are
   saved to a file with save(). Images are loaded from a file with load()
   (or in the constructor) or from an array of data with loadFromData().
   The lists of supported formats are available from
   QImageReader::supportedImageFormats() and
   QImageWriter::supportedImageFormats().

   When loading an image, the file name can be either refer to an actual
   file on disk or to one of the application's embedded resources. See
   the Resource System overview for details on how to embed images and
   other resource files in the application's executable.

   Strings of text may be added to images using setText().

   The QImage class uses implicit sharing, so you can pass QImage objects
   around by value.

   New image formats can be added as plugins.

   See also QImageReader, QImageWriter, QPixmap, QColor, and Shared
   Classes.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QImage::Endian

   This enum type is used to describe the endianness of the CPU and
   graphics hardware. It is provided here for compatibility with earlier
   versions of Qt.

   Constant Value Description
   QImage::IgnoreEndian 2 Endianness does not matter. Useful for some
   operations that are independent of endianness.
   QImage::BigEndian 0 Most significant bit first or network byte order,
   as on SPARC, PowerPC, and Motorola CPUs.
   QImage::LittleEndian 1 Least significant bit first or little endian
   byte order, as on Intel x86.

  enum QImage::Format

   Constant Value Description
   QImage::Format_Invalid 0 The image is invalid.
   QImage::Format_Mono 1 The image is stored using 1-bit per pixel. Bytes
   are packed with the most significant bit (MSB) first.
   QImage::Format_MonoLSB 2 The image is stored using 1-bit per pixel.
   Bytes are packed with the less significant bit (LSB) first.
   QImage::Format_Indexed8 3 The image is stored using 8-bit indexes into
   a colormap.
   QImage::Format_RGB32 4 The image is stored using a 32-bit RGB format
   (0xffRRGGBB).
   QImage::Format_ARGB32 5 The image is stored using a 32-bit ARGB format
   (0xAARRGGBB).
   QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied 6 The image is stored using a
   premultiplied 32-bit ARGB format (0xAARRGGBB), i.e. the red, green,
   and blue channels are multiplied by the alpha component divided by
   255. (If RR, GG, or BB has a higher value than the alpha channel, the
   results are undefined.)

   See also format() and convertToFormat().

  enum QImage::InvertMode

   This enum type is used to describe how pixel values should be inverted
   in the invertPixels() function.

   Constant Value Description
   QImage::InvertRgb 0 Invert only the RGB values and leave the alpha
   channel unchanged.
   QImage::InvertRgba 1 Invert all channels, including the alpha channel.

Member Function Documentation

  QImage::QImage ()

   Constructs a null image.

   See also isNull().

  QImage::QImage ( const QSize & size, Format format )

   Constructs an image with size in format format.

  QImage::QImage ( int width, int height, Format format )

   Constructs an image with width, height in format format.

  QImage::QImage ( uchar * data, int width, int height, Format format )

   Constructs an image width pixels wide, height pixels high with a
   format of format, that uses an existing memory buffer, data. The
   buffer must remain valid throughout the life of the QImage. The image
   does not delete the buffer at destruction.

   Note that data must be 32-bit aligned.

   If the image is in an indexed color format, set the color table for
   the image using setColorTable().

  QImage::QImage ( const char * const[] xpm )

   Constructs an image from xpm, which must be a valid XPM image.

   Errors are silently ignored.

   Note that it's possible to squeeze the XPM variable a little bit by
   using an unusual declaration:
    static const char * const start_xpm[] = {
        "16 15 8 1",
        "a c #cec6bd",
    ....

   The extra const makes the entire definition read-only, which is
   slightly more efficient (e.g. when the code is in a shared library)
   and ROMable when the application is to be stored in ROM.

  QImage::QImage ( const QString & fileName, const char * format = 0 )

   Constructs an image and tries to load the image from the file
   fileName.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the image using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (which is the
   default), the loader probes the file for a header to guess the file
   format.

   If the loading of the image failed, this object is a null image.

   The QImageReader documentation lists the supported image formats and
   explains how to add extra formats.

   The file name can be either refer to an actual file on disk or to one
   of the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System
   overview for details on how to embed images and other resource files
   in the application's executable.

   See also load(), isNull(), and QImageReader.

  QImage::QImage ( const QImage & image )

   Constructs a shallow copy of image.

  QImage::QImage ( const char * fileName, const char * format = 0 )

   Constructs an image and tries to load the image from the file
   fileName.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the image using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (which is the
   default), the loader probes the files for a header to guess the file
   format.

   If the loading of the image failed, this object is a null image.

   The QImageReader documentation lists the supported image formats and
   explains how to add extra formats.

   The file name can be either refer to an actual file on disk or to one
   of the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System
   overview for details on how to embed images and other resource files
   in the application's executable.

   You can disable this constructor by defining QT_NO_CAST_FROM_ASCII
   when you compile your applications. This can be useful if you want to
   ensure that all user-visible strings go through QObject::tr(), for
   example.

   See also QString::fromAscii(), load(), isNull(), and QImageReader.

  QImage::~QImage ()

   Destroys the image and cleans up.

  bool QImage::allGray () const

   Returns true if all the colors in the image are shades of gray (i.e.
   their red, green and blue components are equal); otherwise returns
   false.

   This function is slow for large 32-bit images.

   See also isGrayscale().

  QImage QImage::alphaChannel () const

   Extracts the alpha channel from this image as an 8 bit gray scale
   image and returns it.

  uchar * QImage::bits ()

   Returns a pointer to the first pixel data. This is equivalent to
   scanLine(0).

   See also numBytes(), scanLine(), and jumpTable().

  const uchar * QImage::bits () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  int QImage::bytesPerLine () const

   Returns the number of bytes per image scanline. This is equivalent to
   numBytes()/height().

   See also numBytes() and scanLine().

  QRgb QImage::color ( int i ) const

   Returns the color in the color table at index i. The first color is at
   index 0.

   A color value is an RGB triplet. Use the qRed(), qGreen(), and qBlue()
   functions to get the color value components.

   See also setColor(), numColors(), and QColor.

  QVector<QRgb> QImage::colorTable () const

   Returns the color table of the image, or an empty list of the image
   does not have a color table

   See also numColors().

  QImage QImage::convertToFormat ( Format format, Qt::ImageConversionFlags
  flags = Qt::AutoColor ) const

   Returns a copy of the image in the given format.

   The image conversion flags specified by flags control how the image
   data is handled during the conversion process.

  QImage QImage::convertToFormat ( Format format, const QVector<QRgb> &
  colorTable, Qt::ImageConversionFlags flags = Qt::AutoColor ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a copy of the image converted to the given format, using a
   color table specified by colorTable.

   The image conversion flags specified by flags control how the image
   data is handled during the conversion process.

  QImage QImage::copy ( int x, int y, int w, int h ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a sub-area of the image.

   The returned image is always w by h pixels in size, and is copied from
   position x, y in this image. In areas beyond this image pixels are
   filled with pixel 0.

  QImage QImage::copy ( const QRect & r = QRect() ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a sub-area of the image.

   The returned image always has the size of the rectangle r. In areas
   beyond this image pixels are filled with pixel 0.

   If r is a ull rectangle the entire image is copied.

  QImage QImage::createAlphaMask ( Qt::ImageConversionFlags flags =
  Qt::AutoColor ) const

   Builds and returns a 1-bpp mask from the alpha buffer in this image.
   Returns a null image if the image is of format RGB32.

   See QPixmap::convertFromImage() for a description of the flags
   argument.

   The returned image has little-endian bit order, which you can convert
   to big-endian using convertToFormat().

   See also createHeuristicMask().

  QImage QImage::createHeuristicMask ( bool clipTight = true ) const

   Creates and returns a 1-bpp heuristic mask for this image. It works by
   selecting a color from one of the corners, then chipping away pixels
   of that color starting at all the edges.

   The four corners vote for which color is to be masked away. In case of
   a draw (this generally means that this function is not applicable to
   the image), the result is arbitrary.

   The returned image has little-endian bit order, which you can convert
   to big-endian using convertToFormat().

   If clipTight is true (the default) the mask is just large enough to
   cover the pixels; otherwise, the mask is larger than the data pixels.

   This function disregards the alpha buffer.

   See also createAlphaMask().

  int QImage::depth () const

   Returns the depth of the image.

   The image depth is the number of bits used to encode a single pixel,
   also called bits per pixel (bpp) or bit planes of an image.

   The supported depths are 1, 8 and 32.

   See also convertDepth().

  void QImage::detach ()

   Detaches from shared image d and makes sure that this image is the
   only one referring to the data.

   If multiple images share common data, this image makes a copy of the
   data and detaches itself from the sharing mechanism. Nothing is done
   if there is just a single reference.

   See also copy().

  int QImage::dotsPerMeterX () const

   Returns the number of pixels that fit horizontally in a physical
   meter. This and dotsPerMeterY() define the intended scale and aspect
   ratio of the image.

   See also setDotsPerMeterX().

  int QImage::dotsPerMeterY () const

   Returns the number of pixels that fit vertically in a physical meter.
   This and dotsPerMeterX() define the intended scale and aspect ratio of
   the image.

   See also setDotsPerMeterY().

  void QImage::fill ( uint pixel )

   Fills the entire image with the pixel value pixel.

   If the depth of this image is 1, only the lowest bit is used. If you
   say fill(0), fill(2), etc., the image is filled with 0s. If you say
   fill(1), fill(3), etc., the image is filled with 1s. If the depth is
   8, the lowest 8 bits are used.

   Note: QImage::pixel() returns the color of the pixel at the given
   coordinates; QColor::pixel() returns the pixel value of the underlying
   window system (essentially an index value), so normally you will want
   to use QImage::pixel() to use a color from an existing image or
   QColor::rgb() to use a specific color.

   See also invertPixels(), depth(), hasAlphaBuffer(), and create().

  Format QImage::format () const

   returns the format of the image.

  QImage QImage::fromData ( const uchar * data, int size, const char * format =
  0 )   [static]

   Constructs a QImage from the first size bytes of binary data in data.
   If the loading of the image failed, this object is a null image.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the image using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (which is the
   default), the loader probes the file for a header to guess the file
   format.

   The QImageReader documentation lists the supported image formats and
   explains how to add extra formats.

   See also load(), save(), QImageReader::imageFormat(),
   QPixmap::loadFromData(), and QImageReader.

  QImage QImage::fromData ( const QByteArray & data, const char * format = 0
  )   [static]

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Loads an image from the QByteArray data.

  bool QImage::hasAlphaChannel () const

   Returns true if the image has an alpha channel.

  int QImage::height () const

   Returns the height of the image.

   See also width(), size(), and rect().

  void QImage::invertPixels ( InvertMode mode = InvertRgb )

   Inverts all pixel values in the image.

   If the depth is 32: if mode is InvertRgba (the default), the alpha
   bits are also inverted, otherwise they are left unchanged.

   If the depth is not 32, the argument mode has no meaning. The default
   mode is InvertRgb, which leaves the alpha channel unchanged.

   Note that inverting an 8-bit image means to replace all pixels using
   color index i with a pixel using color index 255 minus i. Similarly
   for a 1-bit image. The color table is not changed.

   See also fill(), depth(), and hasAlphaBuffer().

  bool QImage::isDetached () const

   Returns true if the image is detached; otherwise returns false.

   See also detach().

  bool QImage::isGrayscale () const

   For 32-bit images, this function is equivalent to allGray().

   For 8-bpp images, this function returns true if color(i) is
   QRgb(i,i,i) for all indexes of the color table; otherwise returns
   false.

   See also allGray() and depth().

  bool QImage::isNull () const

   Returns true if it is a null image; otherwise returns false.

   A null image has all parameters set to zero and no allocated data.

  bool QImage::load ( const QString & fileName, const char * format = 0 )

   Loads an image from the file fileName. Returns true if the image was
   successfully loaded; otherwise returns false.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the image using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (which is the
   default), the loader probes the file for a header to guess the file
   format.

   The QImageReader documentation lists the supported image formats and
   explains how to add extra formats.

   The file name can either refer to an actual file on disk or to one of
   the application's embedded resources. See the Resource System overview
   for details on how to embed images and other resource files in the
   application's executable.

   See also loadFromData(), save(), QImageReader::imageFormat(),
   QPixmap::load(), and QImageReader.

  bool QImage::loadFromData ( const uchar * data, int len, const char * format
  = 0 )

   Loads an image from the first len bytes of binary data in data.
   Returns true if the image was successfully loaded; otherwise returns
   false.

   If format is specified, the loader attempts to read the image using
   the specified format. If format is not specified (which is the
   default), the loader probes the file for a header to guess the file
   format.

   The QImageReader documentation lists the supported image formats and
   explains how to add extra formats.

   See also load(), save(), QImageReader::imageFormat(),
   QPixmap::loadFromData(), and QImageReader.

  bool QImage::loadFromData ( const QByteArray & data, const char * format = 0
  )

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Loads an image from the QByteArray data.

  int QImage::metric ( PaintDeviceMetric metric ) const   [virtual protected]

   Returns the size for the specified metric on the device.

   Reimplemented from QPaintDevice.

  QImage QImage::mirrored ( bool horizontal = false, bool vertical = true )
  const

   Returns a mirror of the image, mirrored in the horizontal and/or the
   vertical direction depending on whether horizontal and vertical are
   set to true or false. The original image is not changed.

   See also scaled().

  int QImage::numBytes () const

   Returns the number of bytes occupied by the image data.

   See also bytesPerLine() and bits().

  int QImage::numColors () const

   Returns the size of the color table for the image.

   Notice that numColors() returns 0 for 32-bpp images because these
   images do not use color tables, but instead encode pixel values as RGB
   triplets.

   See also setNumColors() and colorTable().

  QPoint QImage::offset () const

   Returns the number of pixels by which the image is intended to be
   offset by when positioning relative to other images.

  QRgb QImage::pixel ( int x, int y ) const

   Returns the color of the pixel at the coordinates (x, y).

   If (x, y) is not on the image, the results are undefined.

   See also setPixel(), qRed(), qGreen(), qBlue(), and valid().

  int QImage::pixelIndex ( int x, int y ) const

   Returns the pixel index at the given coordinates.

   If (x, y) is not valid, or if the image is not a paletted image
   (depth() > 8), the results are undefined.

   See also valid() and depth().

  QRect QImage::rect () const

   Returns the enclosing rectangle (0, 0, width(), height()) of the
   image.

   See also width(), height(), and size().

  QImage QImage::rgbSwapped () const

   Returns a QImage in which the values of the red and blue components of
   all pixels have been swapped, effectively converting an RGB image to a
   BGR image. The original QImage is not changed.

  bool QImage::save ( const QString & fileName, const char * format, int
  quality = -1 ) const

   Saves the image to the file fileName, using the image file format
   format and a quality factor of quality. quality must be in the range 0
   to 100 or -1. Specify 0 to obtain small compressed files, 100 for
   large uncompressed files, and -1 (the default) to use the default
   settings.

   Returns true if the image was successfully saved; otherwise returns
   false.

   See also load(), loadFromData(), QImageReader::imageFormat(),
   QPixmap::save(), and QImageReader.

  bool QImage::save ( QIODevice * device, const char * format, int quality = -1
  ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   This function writes a QImage to the QIODevice, device. This can be
   used, for example, to save an image directly into a QByteArray:
            QImage image;
            QByteArray ba;
            QBuffer buffer(&ba);
            buffer.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly);
            image.save(&buffer, "PNG"); // writes image into ba in PNG format

  QImage QImage::scaled ( int w, int h, Qt::AspectRatioMode aspectRatioMode =
  Qt::IgnoreAspectRatio, Qt::TransformationMode transformMode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a copy of the image scaled to a rectangle of width w and
   height h according to aspectRatioMode and transformMode.
     * If aspectRatioMode is Qt::IgnoreAspectRatio, the image is scaled
       to (w, h).
     * If aspectRatioMode is Qt::KeepAspectRatio, the image is scaled to
       a rectangle as large as possible inside (w, h), preserving the
       aspect ratio.
     * If aspectRatioMode is Qt::KeepAspectRatioByExpanding, the image is
       scaled to a rectangle as small as possible outside (w, h),
       preserving the aspect ratio.

   If either the width w or the height h is zero or negative, this
   function returns a null image.

   See also scaledToWidth(), scaledToHeight(), and transformed().

  QImage QImage::scaled ( const QSize & size, Qt::AspectRatioMode aspectMode =
  Qt::IgnoreAspectRatio, Qt::TransformationMode transformMode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Scales the image to the given size, using the aspect ratio and
   transformation modes specified by aspectMode and transformMode.

  QImage QImage::scaledToHeight ( int h, Qt::TransformationMode mode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a scaled copy of the image with a height of h pixels using a
   transformation specified by mode. This function automatically
   calculates the width of the image so that the ratio of the image is
   preserved.

   If h is 0 or negative a null image is returned.

   See also scaled(), scaledToWidth(), and transformed().

  QImage QImage::scaledToWidth ( int w, Qt::TransformationMode mode =
  Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a scaled copy of the image with a width of w pixels using the
   specified transformation mode. This function automatically calculates
   the height of the image so that its aspect ratio is preserved.

   If w is 0 or negative a null image is returned.

   See also scaled(), scaledToHeight(), and transformed().

  uchar * QImage::scanLine ( int i )

   Returns a pointer to the pixel data at the scanline with index i. The
   first scanline is at index 0.

   The scanline data is aligned on a 32-bit boundary.

   Warning: If you are accessing 32-bpp image data, cast the returned
   pointer to QRgb* (QRgb has a 32-bit size) and use it to read/write the
   pixel value. You cannot use the uchar* pointer directly, because the
   pixel format depends on the byte order on the underlying platform. Use
   qRed(), qGreen(), qBlue(), and qAlpha() to access the pixels.

   See also bytesPerLine(), bits(), and jumpTable().

  const uchar * QImage::scanLine ( int i ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

  int QImage::serialNumber () const

   Returns a number that uniquely identifies the contents of this QImage
   object. This means that multiple QImage objects can have the same
   serial number as long as they refer to the same contents.

   A null image always have a serial number of 0.

   An example of where this is useful is for caching QImages.

  void QImage::setAlphaChannel ( const QImage & alphaChannel )

   Sets the alpha channel of this image to alphaChannel.

   If alphaChannel is an 8 bit grayscale image, the intensity values are
   written into this buffer directly. Otherwise, alphaChannel is
   converted to 32 bit and the intensity of the RGB pixel values is used.

   The image will be converted to the format Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied
   if the function succeeds.

  void QImage::setColor ( int i, QRgb c )

   Sets a color in the color table at index i to c.

   A color value is an RGB triplet. Use the qRed(), qGreen(), and qBlue()
   functions to get the color value components.

   See also color(), setNumColors(), and numColors().

  void QImage::setColorTable ( const QVector<QRgb> colors )

   Sets the color table used to translate color indexes to RGB values to
   the specified colors.

  void QImage::setDotsPerMeterX ( int x )

   Sets the value returned by dotsPerMeterX() to x.

  void QImage::setDotsPerMeterY ( int y )

   Sets the value returned by dotsPerMeterY() to y.

  void QImage::setNumColors ( int numColors )

   Resizes the color table to numColors colors.

   If the color table is expanded all the extra colors will be set to
   black (RGB 0,0,0).

   See also numColors(), color(), setColor(), and colorTable().

  void QImage::setOffset ( const QPoint & p )

   Sets the value returned by offset() to p.

  void QImage::setPixel ( int x, int y, uint index_or_rgb )

   Sets the pixel index or color at the coordinates (x, y) to
   index_or_rgb.

   If (x, y) is not valid, the result is undefined.

   If the image is a paletted image (depth() <= 8) and index_or_rgb >=
   numColors(), the result is undefined.

   See also pixelIndex(), pixel(), qRgb(), qRgba(), and valid().

  void QImage::setText ( const char * key, const char * lang, const QString & s
  )

   Records string s for the keyword key. The key should be a portable
   keyword recognizable by other software - some suggested values can be
   found in the PNG specification. s can be any text. lang should specify
   the language code (see RFC 1766) or 0.

  QSize QImage::size () const

   Returns the size of the image, i.e. its width and height.

   See also width(), height(), and rect().

  QString QImage::text ( const char * key, const char * lang = 0 ) const

   Returns the string recorded for the keyword key in language lang, or
   in a default language if lang is 0.

  QString QImage::text ( const QImageTextKeyLang & kl ) const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns the string recorded for the keyword and language kl.

  QStringList QImage::textKeys () const

   Returns the keywords for which some texts are recorded.

   Note that if you want to iterate over the list, you should iterate
   over a copy, e.g.
    QStringList list = myImage.textKeys();
    QStringList::Iterator it = list.begin();
    while(it != list.end()) {
        myProcessing(*it);
        ++it;
    }

   See also textList(), text(), setText(), and textLanguages().

  QStringList QImage::textLanguages () const

   Returns the language identifiers for which some texts are recorded.

   Note that if you want to iterate over the list, you should iterate
   over a copy, e.g.
    QStringList list = myImage.textLanguages();
    QStringList::Iterator it = list.begin();
    while(it != list.end()) {
        myProcessing(*it);
        ++it;
    }

   See also textList(), text(), setText(), and textKeys().

  QList<QImageTextKeyLang> QImage::textList () const

   Returns a list of QImageTextKeyLang objects that enumerate all the
   texts key/language pairs set by setText() for this image.

  QImage QImage::transformed ( const QMatrix & matrix, Qt::TransformationMode
  mode = Qt::FastTransformation ) const

   Returns a copy of the image that is transformed with the
   transformation matrix specified by matrix and using the transformation
   mode specified by mode.

   The transformation matrix is internally adjusted to compensate for
   unwanted translation; i.e. the image produced is the smallest image
   that contains all the transformed points of the original image.

   See also scaled(), QPixmap::transformed(), QPixmap::trueMatrix(), and
   QMatrix.

  QMatrix QImage::trueMatrix ( const QMatrix & matrix, int w, int h )
  [static]

   Returns the actual matrix used for transforming a image with w width
   and h height and matrix matrix.

   When transforming a image with transformed(), the transformation
   matrix is internally adjusted to compensate for unwanted translation,
   i.e. transformed() returns the smallest image containing all
   transformed points of the original image.

   This function returns the modified matrix, which maps points correctly
   from the original image into the new image.

   See also transformed() and QMatrix.

  bool QImage::valid ( int x, int y ) const

   Returns true if (x, y) is a valid coordinate in the image; otherwise
   returns false.

   See also width(), height(), and pixelIndex().

  int QImage::width () const

   Returns the width of the image.

   See also height(), size(), and rect().

  QImage::operator QVariant () const

   Returns the image as a QVariant

  bool QImage::operator!= ( const QImage & i ) const

   Returns true if this image and image i have different contents;
   otherwise returns false. The comparison can be slow, unless there is
   some obvious difference, such as different widths, in which case the
   function will return quickly.

   See also operator=().

  QImage & QImage::operator= ( const QImage & image )

   Assigns a shallow copy of image to this image and returns a reference
   to this image.

   See also copy().

  bool QImage::operator== ( const QImage & i ) const

   Returns true if this image and image i have the same contents;
   otherwise returns false. The comparison can be slow, unless there is
   some obvious difference, such as different widths, in which case the
   function will return quickly.

   See also operator=().
