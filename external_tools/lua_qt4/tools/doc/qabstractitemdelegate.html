Detailed Description

   The QAbstractItemDelegate class is used to display and edit data items
   from a model.

   A QAbstractItemDelegate provides the interface and common
   functionality for delegates in the model/view architecture. Delegates
   display individual items in views, and handle the editing of model
   data.

   The QAbstractItemDelegate class is one of the Model/View Classes and
   is part of Qt's model/view framework.

   To render an item in a custom way, you must implement paint() and
   sizeHint(). The QItemDelegate class provides default implementations
   for these functions; if you do not need custom rendering, subclass
   that class instead.

   To provide custom editing, there are two approaches that can be used.
   The first approach is to create an editor widget and display it
   directly on top of the item. To do this you must reimplement
   createEditor() to provide an editor widget, setEditorData() to
   populate the editor with the data from the model, and setModelData()
   so that the delegate can update the model with data from the editor.

   The second approach is to handle user events directly by
   reimplementing editorEvent().

   See also Model/View Programming and QItemDelegate.

Member Type Documentation

  enum QAbstractItemDelegate::EndEditHint

   This enum describes the different hints that the delegate can give to
   the model and view components to make editing data in a model a
   comfortable experience for the user.

   Constant Value Description
   QAbstractItemDelegate::NoHint 0 There is no recommended action to be
   performed.

   These hints let the delegate influence the behavior of the view:

   Constant Value Description
   QAbstractItemDelegate::EditNextItem 1 The view should use the delegate
   to open an editor on the next item in the view.
   QAbstractItemDelegate::EditPreviousItem 2 The view should use the
   delegate to open an editor on the previous item in the view.

   Note that custom views may interpret the concepts of next and previous
   differently.

   The following hints are most useful when models are used that cache
   data, such as those that manipulate date locally in order to increase
   performance or conserve network bandwidth.

   Constant Value Description
   QAbstractItemDelegate::SubmitModelCache 3 If the model caches data, it
   should write out cached data to the underlying data store.
   QAbstractItemDelegate::RevertModelCache 4 If the model caches data, it
   should discard cached data and replace it with data from the
   underlying data store.

   Although models and views should respond to these hints in appropriate
   ways, custom components may ignore any or all of them if they are not
   relevant.

Member Function Documentation

  QAbstractItemDelegate::QAbstractItemDelegate ( QObject * parent = 0 )

   Creates a new abstract item delegate with the given parent.

  QAbstractItemDelegate::~QAbstractItemDelegate ()   [virtual]

   Destroys the abstract item delegate.

  void QAbstractItemDelegate::closeEditor ( QWidget * editor, EndEditHint hint
  = NoHint )   [signal]

   This signal is emitted when the user has finished editing an item
   using the specified editor.

   The hint provides a way for the delegate to influence how the model
   and view behave after editing is completed. It indicates to these
   components what action should be performed next to provide a
   comfortable editing experience for the user. For example, if
   EditNextItem is specified, the view should use a delegate to open an
   editor on the next item in the model.

   See also EndEditHint.

  void QAbstractItemDelegate::commitData ( QWidget * editor )   [signal]

   This signal must be emitted when the editor widget has completed
   editing the data, and wants to write it back into the model.

  QWidget * QAbstractItemDelegate::createEditor ( QWidget * parent, const
  QStyleOptionViewItem & option, const QModelIndex & index ) const   [virtual]

   Returns the editor to be used for editing the data item with the given
   index. Note that the index contains information about the model being
   used. The editor's parent widget is specified by parent, and the item
   options by option.

   The base implementation returns 0. If you want custom editing you will
   need to reimplement this function.

   See also setModelData() and setEditorData().

  bool QAbstractItemDelegate::editorEvent ( QEvent * event, QAbstractItemModel
  * model, const QStyleOptionViewItem & option, const QModelIndex & index )
  [virtual]

   Whenever an event occurs, this function is called with the event model
   option and the index that corresponds to the item being edited.

   The base implementation returns false (indicating that it has not
   handled the event).

  QString QAbstractItemDelegate::elidedText ( const QFontMetrics & fontMetrics,
  int width, Qt::TextElideMode mode, const QString & text )   [static]

   If the string text is wider than width, returns an elided version of
   the string (i.e., a string with "..." in it). Otherwise, returns the
   original string.

   The mode parameter specifies whether the text is elided on the left
   (e.g., "...tech"), in the middle (e.g., "Tr...ch"), or on the right
   (e.g., "Trol...").

   The width is specified in pixels, not characters. The font metrics to
   be used are given by fontMetrics.

  void QAbstractItemDelegate::paint ( QPainter * painter, const
  QStyleOptionViewItem & option, const QModelIndex & index ) const   [pure
  virtual]

   This pure abstract function must be reimplemented if you want to
   provide custom rendering. Use the painter and style option to render
   the item specified by the item index.

   If you reimplement this you must also reimplement sizeHint().

  void QAbstractItemDelegate::setEditorData ( QWidget * editor, const
  QModelIndex & index ) const   [virtual]

   Sets the contents of the given editor to the data for the item at the
   given index. Note that the index contains information about the model
   being used.

   The base implementation does nothing. If you want custom editing you
   will need to reimplement this function.

   See also setModelData().

  void QAbstractItemDelegate::setModelData ( QWidget * editor,
  QAbstractItemModel * model, const QModelIndex & index ) const   [virtual]

   Sets the data for the item at the given index in the model to the
   contents of the given editor.

   The base implementation does nothing. If you want custom editing you
   will need to reimplement this function.

   See also setEditorData().

  QSize QAbstractItemDelegate::sizeHint ( const QStyleOptionViewItem & option,
  const QModelIndex & index ) const   [pure virtual]

   This pure abstract function must be reimplemented if you want to
   provide custom rendering. The options are specified by option and the
   model item by index.

   If you reimplement this you must also reimplement paint().

  void QAbstractItemDelegate::updateEditorGeometry ( QWidget * editor, const
  QStyleOptionViewItem & option, const QModelIndex & index ) const   [virtual]

   Updates the geometry of the editor for the item with the given index,
   according to the rectangle specified in the option. If the item has an
   internal layout, the editor will be laid out accordingly. Note that
   the index contains information about the model being used.

   The base implementation does nothing. If you want custom editing you
   must reimplement this function.
