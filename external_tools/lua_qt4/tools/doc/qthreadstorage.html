Detailed Description

   The QThreadStorage class provides per-thread data storage.

   QThreadStorage is a template class that provides per-thread data
   storage.

   Note that due to compiler limitations, QThreadStorage can only store
   pointers.

   The setLocalData() function stores a single thread-specific value for
   the calling thread. The data can be accessed later using localData().
   QThreadStorage takes ownership of the data (which must be created on
   the heap with new) and deletes it when the thread exits, either
   normally or via termination.

   The hasLocalData() function allows the programmer to determine if data
   has previously been set using the setLocalData() function. This is
   also useful for lazy initializiation.

   For example, the following code uses QThreadStorage to store a single
   cache for each thread that calls the cacheObject() and
   removeFromCache() functions. The cache is automatically deleted when
   the calling thread exits.
    QThreadStorage<QCache<QString, SomeClass> *> caches;

    void cacheObject(const QString &key, SomeClass *object)
    {
        if (!caches.hasLocalData())
            caches.setLocalData(new QCache<QString, SomeClass>);

        caches.localData()->insert(key, object);
    }

    void removeFromCache(const QString &key)
    {
        if (!caches.hasLocalData())
            return;

        caches.localData()->remove(key);
    }

  Caveats

     * As noted above, QThreadStorage can only store pointers due to
       compiler limitations.
     * The QThreadStorage destructor does not delete per-thread data.
       QThreadStorage only deletes per-thread data when the thread exits
       or when setLocalData() is called multiple times.
     * QThreadStorage can only be used with threads started with QThread.
       It cannot be used with threads started using platform-specific
       APIs.
     * As a corollary to the above, platform-specific APIs cannot be used
       to exit or terminate a QThread using QThreadStorage. Doing so will
       cause all per-thread data to be leaked. See QThread::exit() and
       QThread::terminate().
     * QThreadStorage can be used to store data for the main() thread
       after QApplication has been constructed. QThreadStorage deletes
       all data set for the main() thread when QApplication is destroyed,
       regardless of whether or not the main() thread has actually
       finished.
     * The implementation of QThreadStorage limits the total number of
       QThreadStorage objects to 256. An unlimited number of threads can
       store per-thread data in each QThreadStorage object.

Member Function Documentation

  QThreadStorage::QThreadStorage ()

   Constructs a new per-thread data storage object.

  QThreadStorage::~QThreadStorage ()

   Destroys the per-thread data storage object.

   Note: The per-thread data stored is not deleted. Any data left in
   QThreadStorage is leaked. Make sure that all threads using
   QThreadStorage have exited before deleting the QThreadStorage.

   See also hasLocalData().

  bool QThreadStorage::hasLocalData () const

   Returns true if the calling thread has non-zero data available;
   otherwise returns false.

   See also localData().

  T & QThreadStorage::localData ()

   Returns a reference to the data that was set by the calling thread.

   Note: QThreadStorage can only store pointers. This function returns a
   reference to the pointer that was set by the calling thread. The value
   of this reference is 0 if no data was set by the calling thread,

   See also hasLocalData().

  T QThreadStorage::localData () const

   This is an overloaded member function, provided for convenience. It
   behaves essentially like the above function.

   Returns a copy of the data that was set by the calling thread.

   Note: QThreadStorage can only store pointers. This function returns a
   pointer to the data that was set by the calling thread. If no data was
   set by the calling thread, this function returns 0.

   See also hasLocalData().

  void QThreadStorage::setLocalData ( T data )

   Sets the local data for the calling thread to data. It can be accessed
   later using the localData() functions.

   If data is 0, this function deletes the previous data (if any) and
   returns immediately.

   If data is non-zero, QThreadStorage takes ownership of the data and
   deletes it automatically either when the thread exits (either normally
   or via termination) or when setLocalData() is called again.

   Note: QThreadStorage can only store pointers. The data argument must
   be either a pointer to an object created on the heap (i.e. using new)
   or 0. You should not delete data yourself; QThreadStorage takes
   ownership and will delete the data itself.

   See also localData() and hasLocalData().
