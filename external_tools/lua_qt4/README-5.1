Compiling for lua 5.1
---------------------

This package is intended to work with lua 5.1. However, since most
distributions haven't included the package yet (it's still beta at the time
I'm writing this), the build parameters may changes on each system. The easiest
way to change the build parameters is to add a file called 'custom.py' on the
root of the parameter (alongside 'config_linux.py') with your customizations.
For example:

## BEGIN custom.py

TOLUAPP = "tolua++"
extra_cxx_flags = ['-I/usr/include/lua51'] ## default is /usr/local/include/lua51 for linux
lua_libs = ['lua51']

## END custom.py

'TOLUAPP' contains the name of the tolua++ binary, the default is 'tolua++51'
for linux. You can see all the available parameters by running 'scons -h'.
